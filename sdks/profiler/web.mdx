<Note>
    **Note – Not necessary if using Checkout SDK**

    Mangopay’s [Checkout SDK](/sdks/checkout) has the profiler built in, generating and returning the ProfilingAttemptReference for a transaction.
</Note>

<Info>
    **Prerequisites**

    Fraud prevention activated for your environment (Sandbox or Production) – contact Support [via the Hub](https://hub.mangopay.com/) to get started
</Info>

## 1. Get your platform’s profiler URL

Once fraud prevention is activated by Mangopay (in Production or Sandbox): 

1. In the Hub, navigate to _Fraud prevention_.
2. Select the _Integration_ status tab on the left.
3. Note the URL provided in _API CREDENTIALS_ > _WEB PROFILER URL_.

## 2. Integrate the profiler to your platform’s website

Insert the following initialization sample in the code of your website checkout page, after any other scripts and just before the closing `</body>` tag. 

Add the following information:

- `src` – The URL retrieved in Step 1.
- `attemptReference` – Identifier used to match the user’s profiling session to the pay-in call made by your platform’s backend to the Mangopay API. You must generate a unique value upon every form view. You must not use the prefix `mznx- ` for web attempt references, because this prefix is added by the mobile SDKs to identify mobile attempt references. Max. length: 128 characters.

```javascript Initialization example
<script
  type="text/javascript"
  id="SCRIPT_TAG_ID"
  crossorigin="use-credentials"
  src="https://profiler_url"
  async
></script>


<script>
  var scriptID = "SCRIPT_TAG_ID"
  var options = {
    attemptReference: "${attempt_reference}", // inserted by the backend
    sensitiveFields: [],
    secretFields: [],
  }


  if (window.dftp) {
    dftp.init(options)
  } else {
    var el = document.getElementById(scriptID)
    el.addEventListener("load", function () {
      dftp.init(options)
    })
  }
</script>
```

<Check>  
**Best practice – Avoid customization** 

Keep as close as possible to the initialization sample given above to avoid integration errors.
</Check>  

## 3. Define sensitive and secret fields (recommended)

Still in the initialization code, indicate sensitive fields by their ID property for which data shouldn’t be collected:

- `sensitiveFields` – Not sent to the fraud prevention solution but the other behavioral data linked to these fields is still gathered.
- `secretFields` – Not sent to the fraud prevention solution and no behavioral data linked to the fields is gathered.

<Note>
**Best practice – Indicate the card number and CVC as sensitive fields**

Always indicate the card verification code (`cvv`) and card number (`cnn`) as sensitive fields.
</Note>

``` json Initialization of sensitive and secret fields
<script
  type="text/javascript"
  id="SCRIPT_TAG_ID"
  crossorigin="use-credentials"
  src="profiler_url"
  async
></script>


<script>
  var scriptID = "SCRIPT_TAG_ID"
  var options = {
    attemptReference: "${attempt_reference}", // inserted by the backend
    sensitiveFields: ["ccn", "cvv"],
    secretFields: ["password"],
  }


  if (window.dftp) {
    dftp.init(options)
  } else {
    var el = document.getElementById(scriptID)
    el.addEventListener("load", function () {
      dftp.init(options)
    })
  }
</script>
```

## 4. Make sure all the profiling data is collected (optional)

Use the `dftp.profileCompleted` function to ensure that all the profiling data is collected prior to the pay-in call.

This function returns a `Promise` object that is resolved when processing is complete, thereby indicating that it's safe to do the pay-in.

``` json dftp.profileCompleted
try {
 await dftp.profileCompleted()
} catch (err) {
 console.error("Profiling failed with err: " + err)
}
doWorkAfterProfiling()
```

```json dftp usage with promise
dftp
 .profileCompleted()
 .catch((err) => console.error("Profiling failed with err: " + err))
 .finally(doWorkAfterProfiling)
```

The `doWorkAfterProfiling` can be used to submit form data and trigger the pay-in call to the Mangopay API, including the `ProfilingAttemptReference`.

## Note on browser support

The web profiler aims to provide the highest level browser compatibility and data interpretation performance. This is divided into 3 levels: 

1. Full support for modern versions of Firefox, Safari, and Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Opera, etc).  These comprise 95% of web browser internet traffic.
2. Best-effort support for other browsers.
3. Explicit lack of support for retired browsers: Internet Explorer (0.6% of traffic).
