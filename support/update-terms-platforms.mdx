title: T&Cs update – FAQ for platforms
---

Mangopay has made updates to our terms and conditions (T&Cs). The updates serve to improve clarity and accessibility and provide a more detailed description of our services. 

The updated T&Cs apply to your Owner users and frame the payment services we provide to them. As per the terms of our agreement, we request your assistance in communicating these updated T&Cs to your users.

### Where can I find the updated T&Cs for users?
All our T&Cs are on our website <a href="https://mangopay.com/terms-and-conditions/payment-services">Terms and conditions</a> page. The updated version is dated 16 February 2024.

Mangopay’s T&Cs must be published on your website. Users <a href="/guides/users/categories">categorized as Owners</a> must accept them.

### What are the main changes?
We have described the main changes in a dedicated page whose link you can provide to your users.

### How can I notify users about updates to the T&Cs?
To inform your users about the latest changes, you can send out a notification via email or through direct notifications on your platform website or app. You may inform users by other means.

Whatever the method, you must ensure that: 
- Your Owner users are made aware of the updates
- Your Owner users have access to <a href="/support/update-terms-end-users">this page giving an overview of the main changes</a>

You can use this suggested notification or your own wording:
> **Mangopay, our payments partner, has updated its T&Cs**
>
> Mangopay, a regulated payment service provider, handles payments on our behalf. The Mangopay Terms and Conditions for Payment Services Users (T&Cs) constitute an agreement between you and Mangopay that governs your use of its payment solution via our platform.
> 
> Mangopay has updated its T&Cs. You can view the updated version on <a href="https://mangopay.com/terms-and-conditions/payment-services">Mangopay’s website</a>. The changes serve to improve clarity and accessibility and provide a more detailed description of Mangopay’s services. See Mangopay’s <a href="/support/update-terms-end-users">overview of the main changes</a> for more information.
> 
> The updated T&Cs will be effective two months from the date of this notification. By continuing to use our platform after this period, you are acknowledging and agreeing to the updated T&Cs. Until then, Mangopay current T&Cs apply. If you do not agree to the updated T&Cs, you can terminate the T&Cs within two months (before the modification takes effect). In such case, your account will be permanently closed and you will no longer be able to use our platform. 

### What should I do if a user refuses to accept the updated T&Cs?
If the user disagrees with Mangopay’s updated T&Cs, the user is required to remove any funds from wallets they hold before proceeding with the closure of their Mangopay Account. Once their wallets are empty, please contact our Support team <a href="mailto:end-users@mangopay.com">by email</a> or <a href="https://hub.mangopay.com/">from the Hub</a> to initiate the account closure.

Please note that if a user continues to use your platform without transferring out their remaining funds and closing their account, this will be interpreted by Mangopay as the user's acknowledgment and acceptance of the updated T&Cs.

### How can I notify Mangopay when the communication to users has been done?
Please reply to the same email address that Mangopay used to contact you. In your reply, kindly confirm that you've accurately informed your users about the updated T&Cs.

Mangopay requires this confirmation from you. Thank you in advance for your cooperation.
