<ResponseField name="Validity" type="string" >    
**Returned values:** `UNKNOWN`, `VALID`, `INVALID`

Whether the card is valid or not.  
- `UNKNOWN` – No payment or card validation has been processed, so the validity of the card remains unknown.  
- `VALID` – The first payment or card validation using the card was processed successfully within 24 hours of the initial card registration.  
- `INVALID` – The first payment or card validation using the card was attempted and failed, or the status of the corresponding card registration was `CREATED` for more than 24 hours.  
Once a card is set to `INVALID`, it cannot be set back to `VALID`. A new card registration will be necessary to make a payment.
