The transaction natures to be taken into account.  
- `REGULAR` – Relative to most of the transactions (pay-ins, payouts, and transfers) in a usual workflow.  
- `REPUDIATION` – Automatic withdrawal of funds from the platform’s repudiation wallet as part of the dispute process (when the user has requested a chargeback).  
- `REFUND` – Reimbursement of a transaction to the user (pay-in refund), to a wallet (transfer refund), or of a payout (payout refund, only initiated by Mangopay).  
- `SETTLEMENT` – Transfer made to the repudiation wallet by the platform to settle a lost dispute.
