<ResponseField name="FreeCycles" type="integer" >    
The number of initial consecutive pay-ins where there will be no debited funds nor fees.  
This value cannot exceed the `CycleNumber` value (for recurring objects with an `EndDate`, `FixedNextAmount`, and `Frequency`).  
Note: When creating a recurring pay-in (MIT) for a pay-in subject to a free cycle, the `DebitedFunds` and `Fees` parameters should be ignored. Otherwise, the pay-in will fail with the corresponding error returned.
