**Default value:** `DEFAULT`

The mode applied for the 3DS2 protocol for CB, Visa, and Mastercard. The options are:  
- `DEFAULT` – Requests an exemption to strong customer authentication (SCA), and thus a frictionless payment experience, if allowed by your Mangopay contract and accepted by the issuer.  
- `FORCE` – Requests SCA.  
- `NO_CHOICE` – Leaves the choice to the issuer whether to allow for a frictionless payment experience or to enforce SCA.
