<ParamField body="Status" type="string" >     
**Allowed values:** `ENDED`

The status of the recurring registration:  
- `CREATED` – The recurring registration was created, but no recurring pay-in has yet been made.  
- `AUTHENTICATION_NEEDED` – The latest recurring pay-in linked to the registration object was refused. The registration object can still be used, but you need to execute a new customer-initiated transaction (CIT) for the end user to reauthenticate.  
- `IN_PROGRESS` – The recurring registration object is in use and the subsequent corresponding recurring pay-ins can be made.  
- `ENDED` – The recurrence ended: the registration can no longer be modified nor reused.
