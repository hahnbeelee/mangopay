<ParamField body="ModeApplied" type="string">     
**Returned values:** `STANDARD`, `INSTANT_PAYMENT`, `INSTANT_PAYMENT_ONLY`, `PENDING_RESPONSE`

The payout mode actually applied for the transaction. The payout mode can revert to standard if some of the prerequisites for an instant payment are not met.  
- `STANDARD` – A standard bank wire is requested and the processing time of the funds is about 48 hours.  
- `INSTANT_PAYMENT` – An instant payment bank wire is requested and the processing time is within 25 seconds (subject to prerequisites); if the prerequisites are not met, then the payment will fall back to the `STANDARD` mode.  
- `INSTANT_PAYMENT_ONLY` – An instant payment bank wire is requested and the processing time is within 25 seconds, but if any prerequisite is not met or another problem occurs, there is no fallback: the wallet is automatically refunded and the payout is not completed.  
- `PENDING_RESPONSE` – Temporary state to accommodate the short latency between the moment the request is sent and the moment the mode is applied (or a fallback occurs).
