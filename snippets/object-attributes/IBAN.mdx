<ParamField body="IBAN" type="string">  
<LengthUpTo34Characters />     
The IBAN (international bank account number) of the bank account.
It follows the CCDDBBAN format in which:  
- CC represents the country code (ISO 3166-1 alpha 2)  
- DD represents two check digits used by banking systems to avoid simple errors  
- BBAN stands for the Basic Bank Account Number which is up to 30 alphanumeric characters that are country-specific.  
Note: You will need a valid IBAN (i.e., existing in real life) when testing on a Sandbox account even if no actual payout will be processed.
