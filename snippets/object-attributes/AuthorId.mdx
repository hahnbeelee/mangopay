  
<ParamField body="AuthorId" type="string">     
The unique identifier of the user at the source of the transaction.  
Best practice: When the payout author is different from the bank account owner, the Payout `AuthorId` value must be different from the Bank Account `UserId` value as well. Otherwise, Mangopayâ€™s Compliance team will reject the payout.
