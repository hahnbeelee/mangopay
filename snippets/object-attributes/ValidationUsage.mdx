**Default value:** MIT\
**Allowed values:** MIT, CIT

Indicates the intended usage of the card:

- CIT – For customer-initiated transactions (CITs), meaning 3DS is less likely to be required on the card validation.
- MIT – For merchant-initiated transactions (MITs), meaning 3DS is more likely to be required on the card validation.

_Note: The MIT value is returned automatically if the SecureMode value is FORCE, even if CIT is sent._
