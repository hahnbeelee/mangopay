The type of dispute:
- `CONTESTABLE` – Dispute for which the chargeback can be contested by providing proof (i.e., Dispute Documents) justifying the original transaction.  
- `NOT_CONTESTABLE` – Dispute that is automatically closed after its creation, without any action possible for the platform.  
- `RETRIEVAL` – Dispute that is actually a chargeback warning issued by the bank. The platform is required to provide documents, but no funds will be taken from the Repudiation Wallet.
