#### More information  

This error usually occurs when there are conflicting attempts to access the wallet funds.  

#### Causes  

This error may be caused by two transactions attempted simultaneously (e.g. two conversions, a transfer and conversion).  

#### What to do  

In such cases, use the endpoints <a href="/api-reference/transactions/list-transactions-wallet">List Transactions for a Wallet</a> and <a href="/api-reference/wallets/view-wallet">View a Wallet</a> on the `DebitedWalletId` to understand the recent activity. Retrying the conversion may be possible if there are sufficient funds still in the wallet.  

#### Example  

In the following example, two conversions were triggered the same second, causing the debit to fail.Â
