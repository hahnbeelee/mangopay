#### Causes  

This error occurs when there are not enough funds in the wallet for which the author of the transaction is the actual e-money owner. This is usually due to an issue with the money flow implementation.  

#### What to do  

In such cases, platforms may need to review their implementation of refunds to ensure that if the initial pay-in automatically triggers a transfer, then the transfer is refunded before the pay-in, thereby assuring that the funds to be refunded are present.
