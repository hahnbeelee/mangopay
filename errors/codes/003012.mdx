#### Causes  

This error may be triggered when the platform tries to settle a dispute that has already been settled. This usually occurs if the initial transaction has no fees.  

#### What to do  

In such cases, you should check if the dispute has indeed been settled. If not, you should contact Mangopay Support team <a href="https://hub.mangopay.com/" target="_blank">via the Hub</a>.  

#### Example  

In the example below, a settlement transaction was attempted for an already settled dispute.
