### Additional information  

Mangopay has safety mechanisms to avoid unwanted duplicated transactions.  

### Causes  

This error occurs when making two subsequent partial refunds in less than 24 hours with the same `Amount` value for the same initial transaction.  

### What to do  

In such cases, the platform can either wait 24 hours to make the second refund or make a refund with a different `Amount` value than the preceding one.  

### Example  

In the example below, the API response when attempting to make an identical partial refund (with the <a href="/api-reference/refunds/create-refund-payin">Create a Refund for a PayIn</a> endpoint) to the same pay-in twice in less than 24 hours.
