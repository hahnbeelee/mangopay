#### Causes  

This error is triggered when attempting to make a payout to a bank that has been blocked by Mangopay’s teams.  

#### What to do  

In such cases, the user can create a different bank account, belonging to an authorized bank.  

If there seems to be no reason for the bank to be blocked, platforms can contact Mangopay’s Support team to review the situation.
