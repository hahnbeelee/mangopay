#### Causes  

Some payouts are subject to manual review by Mangopay’s teams for reasons of risk management or AML/CFT.   

This error occurs when a manual review is required on an instant payout requested with `INSTANT_PAYMENT_ONLY` as the value for `PayoutModeRequested`.  

The mode has no fallback to standard processing to enable the review, so an error is returned.  

#### What to do  

Create the payout request again with the `PayoutModeRequested` as `STANDARD` or `INSTANT_PAYMENT` (which falls back to `STANDARD` in case of manual review). This will enable the manual review to be performed by Mangopay’s team.
