#### Causes  

This error may occur when the platform attempts to settle a lost dispute with a fees amount higher than the initial transaction fees amount.  

#### What to do  

The platform needs to settle the dispute with the relevant fees value (i.e., the initial fees).  

#### Example  

In the example below, multiple settlement transfers were made for the same dispute, and the sum of the settled fees exceed the initial transaction fees.
