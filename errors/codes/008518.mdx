#### Causes  

This error is triggered when attempting to make a payout to a CA bank account that has been blocked by Mangopay’s teams.  

#### What to do  

In such cases, the user can create a different bank account which is authorized.  

If there seems to be no reason for the bank account to be blocked, platforms can contact Mangopay’s Support team to review the situation.
