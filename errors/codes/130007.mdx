#### Additional information  

Instant payouts have a fallback mechanism: when the payout cannot be processed as an instant payout, a standard one will be processed instead. This is what occurred when you encounter the 130007 error code.  

#### Causes  

This error occurs when the destination bank is not a participant of the SEPA Instant Credit Transfer scheme of the European Payments Council (EPC).  

#### What to do  

You can check if the bank is reachable beforehand by using the dedicated <a href="/api-reference/payouts/check-instant-payout-eligibility">POST Check Instant Payout eligibility</a> endpoint.  

#### Example  

When the bank is not reachable, the instant payment request is processed as a standard payout. Information about the error is returned in the `FallbackReason` parameter.
