#### Causes  

This error occurs when the cardholderâ€™s bank refuses the payment because the card limit has been reached.  

#### What to do  

In such cases, end users can:  
- Retry the payment once the limit is reset  
- Contact their bank to have more information or have the limit raised  
- Try another payment method.
