## Official WordPress plugin  

Mangopay provides an official integration for WordPress (coupled with WC Vendors, and WooCommerce), enabling you to process payments by using the Mangopay API.  

Because this is an official integration maintained by Mangopay teams, you can benefit from:  
- Mangopay support  
- Regular updates  

The Mangopay WooCommerce/WC Vendors plugin requires two other WordPress plugins:  
- WooCommerce : Allows you to build an online store on a WordPress site. WooCommerce primarily manages products, orders, and transactions.  
- WC Vendors : Allows you to turn a WooCommerce e-shop into a <Marketplace content="marketplace" /> with multiple vendors, or <Seller content="sellers" />. WC Vendors primarily manages sellers - their capabilities, commissions, and payouts.  

The Mangopay plugin is compatible with any WordPress theme.  

<Note>  
    **Note - To use Mangopay’s official integration, you’ll need:** 
    
    Both WooCommerce and WC Vendors plugins installed  
    A Mangopay API key  
</Note>

### Key features  
- Process payments with a compliant workflow inside your marketplace

        <tr>
            <td class="table-content">_Accounts & Privacy_ tab</td>
            <td class="table-content">

            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>  

## Seller management  

<Seller content="Sellers" /> need to set up their account to successfully use Mangopay features. To fully benefit from the payment experience and collect their revenues, they should:  
- Complete their profile  
- Accept Mangopay T&C  
- Go through the verification process  
- Create their bank account  

By default, when installing the Mangopay plugin, new fields are added to the WC Vendors dashboard so that all the mandatory fields necessary to work with Mangopay are available and identified.  

<Note>  
**Note - Customize the seller experience** 
  
You can select a specific WordPress page or even customize the vendor Dashboard.  
It can be done by going to the WC Vendors plugin, Settings view (left menu), Display tab. From there, you’ll find the options to customize the Dashboard page and the shop settings pages.  
</Note>  

### How to verify a seller  

To receive a payout, your seller should be verified by Mangopay. To do so, they need to upload the necessary verification documents according to the <a href="/guides/users/verification/requirements">requirements by user type</a>.

<Warning>  
**Warning – Storage of KYC documents prohibited** 
  
You must only use the plugin form for document management.   
Your seller should never send you data or verification document by email or directly to your server.  
You’re not allowed to store verification documents (in any format, even encoded) on your side.  
</Warning>  

Two options are available to upload verification documents.  

1. Sellers can upload their verification documents by filling the corresponding form in the shop Settings page.  

2. Alternatively, sellers may be able to connect to the wp-admin to upload their verification documents. All the necessary fields are available in the seller’s profile.  

<Warning>  
**Warning - Mangopay T&C acceptance** 
  
Your seller must accept Mangopay T&C. This field is available below the Bank account information.  
</Warning>  

### How to create a bank account  

In addition to being verified, sellers must provide a valid bank account in order to successfully collect their revenues. To do so, they need to go to the shop Settings page and enter their bank account information.  

Mangopay supports any type of bank account.  

## Refunds and payouts (Mangopay Dashboard)  

Some features are not handled by the Mangopay WooCommerce/WC Vendors plugin and should be done in the <MangopayDashboard content="Mangopay Dashboard" /> (available through the Mangopay Hub).  

### Refund  

Doing a refund is possible through the Mangopay Dashboard.  

1. Get the pay-in Id in WooCommerce  

In the WooCommerce plugin, Orders menu, open the order for which a refund is to be made.  

In the Custom Fields section, get the **mp_transaction_Id **value.  

2. Make the refund in the Mangopay Dashboard  

In the Mangopay Dashboard, search for the pay-in with your mp_transaction_Id value (which corresponds to the Mangopay pay-in Id), and make the refund.  

### Seller payout  

1. Transfer the revenues to the seller  

Before payout, commissions (i.e., the seller’s revenues minus the <Fees content="fees" />) should be transferred to the seller's wallet.  

There are two ways to proceed:  
- Manually : In the WC Vendors plugin, Commissions menu, select any commission with the “Due” status and select the “Mangopay payout”.  
- Automatically : In the WooCommerce plugin, Settings menu, Payments tab, click on the “Manage” button for the Mangopay payment method, and then activate the “Enable direct payout of vendors” option. As a result, the plugin will perform a transfer from the buyer's wallet to the seller's wallet when the status of the order turns into “completed”.  

<Note>  
**Note - Commissions “payouts” are actually transfers** 
  
The “Mangopay payout” and “Enable direct payout of vendors” options do not refer to a <Payout content="payout" /> in the Mangopay sense of the term (i.e., wiring the funds to an external bank account).   
It is actually a <Transfer content="transfer" /> from one wallet (the <Buyer content="buyer's" />) to another (the <Seller content="seller's" />).  
</Note>  

2. Make the payout to the seller’s external bank account  

In order to transfer the revenues of the sellers to their external bank account, you’ll need the user’s Id and then access the Mangopay Dashboard.  

In the WordPress Users menu, search for the seller for which a payout is to be made.  

In the MANGOPAY section, click on “do a payout” to be redirected to the relevant view in the Mangopay Dashboard in order to make the payout.
