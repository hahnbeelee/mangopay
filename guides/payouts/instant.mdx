Instant payouts are available in EUR in the SEPA zone and are usually processed in about 25 seconds. Platforms can choose whether to send funds as an instant payout, and whether to use standard processing as a backup (or not) in case of any issue.  

For guidance in integrating instant payouts, see:

## Criteria

In addition to the standard payout prerequisites, the following criteria are checked by Mangopay before sending a request for instant payout:

  <Step title="Feature is activated" icon="check">
    Contact Support <a href="https://hub.mangopay.com/" target="_blank">via the Hub</a> to activate in Sandbox.

  <Step title="Payout is in EUR" icon="check">
    
  </Step>
  <Step title="Receiving bank is in the SEPA zone" icon="check">
    
  </Step>
</Steps>

Once these verifications are made, Mangopay proceeds with the request for an instant payout.  

Several other criteria must be respected for the operation to be instantaneous. If any one of the criteria below is not satisfied, the instant payment request is processed as a standard payout.  

<Steps>
  <Step title="Receiving bank is reachable" icon="check">
    Reachable banks participate in the **SEPA Instant Credit Transfer** scheme of the **European Payments Council** (EPC). You can check if the bank is reachable by using the dedicated <a href="/api-reference/payouts/check-instant-payout-eligibility">Check Instant Payout eligibility</a> endpoint.  
  </Step>
  <Step title="No opposition arises from the banking situations of the creditor or debtor" icon="check">
    These oppositions can be functional (e.g., deceased account holder) or technical (e.g., the receiving bank does not respond).  
  </Step>
  <Step title="Unique successful instant payment in the last 24 hours" icon="check">
    No instant payment has been successfully made to the same bank account for the exact same amount in the last 24 hours.

    Subsequent attempts with the same specific amount and bank account either fail or fall back to standard mode depending on the payout mode requested.
