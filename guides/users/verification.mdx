The <Payout content="payout" /> stage of the payments workflow is highly regulated. Mangopay has legal obligations to verify the identity of users who wish to pay money out to their bank account.  

The obligations placed on payments companies like Mangopay are designed to prevent the misuse of the financial system for illegitimate purposes. The rules imposed are referred to as <Aml content="anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT)" />.  

## Scope  

A verified user can request a payout. You can only request verification for Owner users.  

To be verified, an Owner user must provide at least one official document as evidence of the information they have declared.  

The documents provided by the user are examined by Mangopay for authenticity and consistency with the information the user has declared.  

Once a userâ€™s required documents have been validated, they receive verified status. This status is indicated in the API by the `KYCLevel` parameter, which is `LIGHT` by default and then becomes `REGULAR` when they are verified. Only when the user has the `REGULAR` verified status can they request a payout.  

The verification requirements are different for natural persons and legal entities. For details, see:
