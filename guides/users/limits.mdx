As explained in the <a href="/guides/users/verification">Verification</a> section, Owner users who are not verified are limited in the actions they can perform on your platform.  

For the vast majority of our <Platform content="platforms" />, who operate under Mangopay’s Payment Services, these limits mean that Owner users must be verified to be able to request <Payout content="payouts" />.  

### Payment Services

<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th class="header">Pay-in</th>
            <td class="table-content">No limit</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th class="header">Payout</th>
            <td class="table-content">Verification is compulsory for any amount</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

However, as an <Emi content="Electronic Money Institution" />, Mangopay is also authorized to provide Electronic Money Services. In these services, the platform has a different legal status in relation to Mangopay, which is better suited in some exceptional cases.   

<Note>  
**Note - Availability of services depends on region** 
  
For regulatory and commercial reasons, Electronic Money Services may not be available in your region or for your products.  
</Note>  

The limits that apply to Electronic Money Services are different to those of Payment Services.
