## Scope  

As part of the verification process, certain legal entities are required by <Aml content="AML legislation" /> to disclose their <BeneficialOwner content="beneficial owners" /> (also known as ultimate beneficial owners, or UBOs).   

Mangopay needs to know who really profits from the entity to be able to properly assess risk and help prevent financial crime.  

A declaration of beneficial ownership is always required to verify legal users of the types:  
- Business  
- Partnership  

The declaration is not required for other types of legal users (nor for natural users).  

## Declaration

The declaration consists of two parts:  
- Information about all <BeneficialOwner content="beneficial owners" /> (see the <a href="/guides/glossary#beneficial-owner">glossary</a> for a complete definition)  
- Documents providing evidence for the declaration  

### Required information  

For each beneficial owner, the following information must be provided:  
- First name  
- Last name  
- Date of birth  
- Country of birth  
- City of birth  
- Nationality  
- Address  

The information for all beneficial owners must be provided via the API with the UBO declaration endpoints:

Learn how to submit a UBO Declaration
</Card>  

### Documentary evidence  

The information submitted about the beneficial owners is checked against the user’s verification documents, notably the registration proof and articles of association.  

If the verification documents do not provide sufficient information about the beneficial owners, then a sworn statement may be requested to complete the declaration. This document, called the Shareholder Declaration, is a Mangopay form which must be completed and signed by the legal representative of the legal user.  

## Process  

<Note>  
**Note - Submit verification documents before UBO Declaration** 
  
Because the information in the UBO Declaration is compared with the verification documents, it is necessary to submit all the required documents first before submitting the UBO Declaration.  
</Note>  

The process for declaring beneficial ownership can be broken down into the following steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Submission">
    The platform collects and submits information via the UBO Declaration object for the legal user.  
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verification">
    Mangopay’s teams check the declaration against the verification documents submitted.  
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complementary details (if necessary)">
    Depending on the response from Mangopay, the platform provides complementary documents or information for the legal user. The UBO Declaration may need to be resubmitted to ensure that it is consistent with the validated documents.  
  </Step>
</Steps>

The response from Mangopay is indicated in the `Status` of the <a href="/api-reference/ubo-declarations/ubo-declaration-object">UBO Declaration object</a>:
- `VALIDATED` - The UBO Declaration is validated by Mangopay.  
- `INCOMPLETE` - The UBO Declaration is deemed incomplete by Mangopay. The object can be modified to complete the declaration.  
- `REFUSED` - The UBO Declaration is rejected by Mangopay. The object can’t be modified and must be recreated to be submitted.  

## In case of refused or incomplete declaration  

For incomplete or refused declarations, you can learn more about the reasons for refusal in the `Reason` and `Message` parameters.  

<Note>  
**Note - Only INCOMPLETE objects can be modified and resubmitted** 
  
If the object status is `INCOMPLETE`, the same UBO Declaration object can be modified and resubmitted. If the status is `REFUSED`, a new UBO Declaration object needs to be created (if relevant following the response).  
</Note>  

The following table describes the `Reason` values about why the UBO Declaration was marked `REFUSED` or `INCOMPLETE`. Ensure you check the `Message` parameter for personalized information from Mangopay’s teams.

Check your calculations of who is a beneficial owner and ensure that they are each present as UBOs in the UBO Declaration.
