## Introduction  

This how-to guide will show you how to successfully submit a UBO Declaration for validation by Mangopay.  

<Info>
**Prerequisites**

- A `ClientId` and an API key – you can create these in the <a href="https://hub.mangopay.com/" target="_blank">Mangopay Hub</a> (or else <a href="https://mangopay.com/contact" target="_blank">contact Sales</a> to get started)
- A legal Owner user whose `LegalPersonType` is `BUSINESS` or `PARTNERSHIP` and for whom you have submitted all the necessary KYC Documents (see <a href="/guides/users/verification/documents/submission/how-to">How to submit a KYC Document</a>).
</Info>

The UBO Declaration object allows you to submit information concerning the beneficial owners of a legal user. Find out more about the process in the <a href="/guides/users/verification/beneficial-owners">Beneficial owners</a> article.  

<Note>  
**Best practice - Submit KYC Documents before UBO Declaration ** 
  
Because the information in the UBO Declaration is compared with the verification documents, it is necessary to submit all the required documents first before submitting the UBO Declaration.  
</Note>

<a href="/guides/users/verification/documents/submission/how-to">How to submit a KYC Document &rarr;</a>  

## 1. Create the UBO Declaration  

Create the UBO Declaration with the `UserId`.

> [**POST** /v2.01/&lcub;ClientId&rcub;/users/&lcub;UserId&rcub;/kyc/ubodeclarations](/api-reference/ubo-declarations/create-ubo-declaration)

<CodeGroup>  
    <PhpCreateUboDeclaration />
    <NodeCreateUboDeclaration />
    <RubyCreateUboDeclaration />
    <JavaCreateUboDeclaration />
    <PythonCreateUboDeclaration />
</CodeGroup>  

The response shows the `Status` “CREATED” and contains an `Id`, which is the unique identifier of the UBO Declaration object. You need to save this for the next step.

<hr />  

## 2. Create the first UBO  

With the `Id` of the UBO Declaration as the `UboDeclarationId` path parameter, create the first UBO, entering the required information.  

> [**POST** /v2.01/&lcub;ClientId&rcub;/users/&lcub;UserId&rcub;/kyc/ubodeclarations/&lcub;UboDeclarationId&rcub;/ubos](/api-reference/ubo-declarations/create-ubo)

<CodeGroup>  
    <RestCreateUbo />
    <PhpCreateUbo />
    <NodeCreateUbo />
    <RubyCreateUbo />
    <CreateUboJava />
    <PythonCreateUbo />
</CodeGroup>

<hr />  

## 3. Create additional UBOs as needed  

Repeat Step 2 as many times as necessary. Your UBO Declaration can contain a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 15 UBOs.

<hr />  

## 4. Submit the UBO Declaration  

Once all UBOs are created and correctly declared, submit the declaration for review by Mangopay’s teams by changing the `Status` from `CREATED` to `VALIDATION_ASKED`.  

> [**PUT** /v2.01/&lcub;ClientId&rcub;/users/&lcub;UserId&rcub;/kyc/ubodeclarations/&lcub;UboDeclarationId&rcub;](/api-reference/ubo-declarations/submit-ubo-declaration)

<CodeGroup>  
    <RestSubmitUboDeclaration />
    <PhpSubmitUboDeclaration />
    <NodeSubmitUboDeclaration />
    <RubySubmitUboDeclaration />
    <SubmitUboDeclaractionJava />
    <PythonSubmitUboDeclaration />
</CodeGroup>

<hr />  

## 5. Set up relevant hooks (recommended)  

There are dedicated hooks to provide notifications of the outcome of the review by Mangopay:  
- UBO_DECLARATION_VALIDATED, notifying that the UBO Declaration status has changed to `VALIDATED`.  
- UBO_DECLARATION_REFUSED, notifying that the UBO Declaration status has changed to `REFUSED`.  
- UBO_DECLARATION_INCOMPLETE, notifying that the UBO Declaration status has changed to `INCOMPLETE`.  

<Note>  
**Note - Only `INCOMPLETE` declarations can be reused** 
  
UBO Declarations can be resubmitted or not depending on their status:  
- `REFUSED` - The object can’t be re-submitted. You need to create a new declaration.  
- `INCOMPLETE` - The object can be modified and re-submitted.  
For more information about why the declaration wasn’t validated, see the `Reason` and `Message` parameters returned by the <a href="/api-reference/ubo-declarations/view-ubo-declaration">View a UBO Declaration</a> endpoint.   
</Note>

<hr />  

## 6. Simulate the response from Mangopay in Sandbox  

The outcome of Mangopay’s review is indicated by the change of status of the declaration.  

In the Dashboard, you can simulate the response from Mangopay:  
1. Go to the _Sandbox operations_ section.  
2. Select _Process a UBO declaration_. 
3. Enter the identifiers of the declaration and the user, then select the action you want to simulate.
4. Click _Submit_ to send the response.

<hr />  

## 7. If incomplete, take any remedial action  

If the response from Mangopay is that the UBO Declaration is `INCOMPLETE`, check the [View a UBO Declaration](/api-reference/ubo-declarations/view-ubo-declaration) endpoint for information on why.  

Take the necessary steps indicated by Mangopay in the `Reason` and `Message` parameters.  

```json API Response example
{
   "Id": "160691001",
   "UserId": "160686549",
   "CreationDate": 1674491433,
   "ProcessedDate": null,
   "Status": "INCOMPLETE",
   "Reason": "SHAREHOLDERS_DECLARATION_NEEDED",
   "Message": null,
   "Ubos": [
       {
           "Id": "160691407",

           "LastName": "Boulanger",
           "FirstName": "Marie",
           "Birthday": 652117514,

               "AddressLine1": "16 rue de Paris",
               "AddressLine2": null,
               "City": "Paris",
               "Region": "Ile-de-France",
               "PostalCode": "75001",
               "Country": "FR"
           },
           "Birthplace": {
               "City": "Paris",
               "Country": "FR"
           },
           "IsActive": true
       }
   ]
}
```  

### If further documents required  

It may be that additional documentary evidence is required, such as the Shareholder Declaration form or another verification document. Any additional documents should be submitted in a KYC Document object.

[How to submit a KYC Document &rarr;](/guides/users/verification/documents/submission/how-to)

### If UBO added in error  

It may be that the declaration contains information about someone who is not in fact a beneficial owner. If this happens, change the `IsActive` parameter of the UBO object to false to have them disregarded from the declaration. This action is irreversible, but another UBO can be added in their place.

   },
   "IsActive": false
}
```

## 8. Once remediated, re-submit the UBO Declaration  

Once the reason that the declaration was marked `INCOMPLETE` has been addressed, re-submit the UBO Declaration by changing the Status to `VALIDATED_ASKED` (as in Step 4).   

<Warning>  
**Caution - UBO Declaration must be consistent with documents** 
  
If additional documentary evidence was supplied to support the declaration, you must still ensure that the information in the UBO Declaration object is consistent with the documents before re-submitting.   
</Warning>
