## Process  

The verification process can be broken down into the following steps:  

<Steps> 
    <Step>The platform collects the necessary information for the user.</Step> 
    <Step>The platform collects the relevant document(s) from the user and submits them to Mangopay.</Step> 
    <Step>Against the information declared, Mangopay verifies the documents and either validates or refuses them.</Step> 
    <Step>In case of refusal, new documents may be required from the end user.</Step>  
</Steps>  

You can submit end users' verification documents with the dedicated KYC Documents endpoints.   

Submission requires a minimum of 3 API calls:
- [Create the KYC Document](/api-reference/kyc-documents/create-kyc-document)
- Upload each file as a [KYC Document Page](/api-reference/kyc-documents/create-kyc-document-page) (this call must be repeated for each file)
- [Submit the KYC Document](/api-reference/kyc-documents/submit-kyc-document) by changing its status.  

Follow the how-to guide for a step-by-step explanation:

Submit a KYC Document for verification
</Card>

<Note>  
**Note - Verification time** 
  
Verification takes on average 24 hours on <WorkingDay content="working days" /> to be completed by the Mangopay Compliance team.  

You can use [webhooks](/webhooks) to be notified of the KYC Document status update.  
</Note>  

Mangopay returns the following statuses once the verification process is done:
- `VALIDATED` – The document is validated by Mangopay’s team.
- `REFUSED` – The document is rejected by Mangopay’s team.

The following status may also be returned as a result of the [Verification downgrade](/guides/users/verification/downgrade) mechanism.
- `OUT_OF_DATE` – The user's key details have been modified.
The downgrade can be triggered after submission (in the case of identity proofs) and validation (in the case of all documents).

## File constraints  

When uploading files as pages of the KYC Documents through the dedicated endpoints, you need to respect the the following constraints.  

#### Format  

Accepted formats: PDF, JPEG, JPG, PNG.  

#### Encoding  

All files must be Base64 encoded.  

#### Size  

File size (per KYC Document Page) is essential for good quality, therefore the following rules apply:  

#### Identity proof  
- Minimum size: 32KB  
- Maximum size: about 7MB (10MB when Base64 encoded)  

#### Other document types   
- Minimum size: 1KB  
- Maximum size: about 7MB (10MB when Base64 encoded)  

#### Number of files per KYC Document  

A maximum of 5 files can be submitted for a document, created as KYC Document Pages in the API.  

This limit applies to all types of verification documents.  

Note: A document typically requires 1 to 3 files, for example the front and back of an ID card, or a document and its translation.  

## Best practices

Good quality submissions are necessary to effectively assess whether documents are genuine or not.   

For identity proof documents, refer to:

</Card>

For other types, the document should be:

    </Card>

    <Card icon={IconGreenCheck}>
        Accompanied by an official translation if **not** in one of the accepted languages: English, French, Spanish, German, Dutch, Italian and Portuguese.

        The official translation must be to English or French, signed by a certified sworn translator, and submitted in the same KYC Document object.
