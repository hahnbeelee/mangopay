Both natural and legal users must provide an official identity document (ID) as proof of identity during the verification process. For legal users, it is the entityâ€™s <LegalRepresentative content="legal representative" /> who must provide proof of identity.  

<Warning>  
**Caution - Accepted documents vary by country** 
  
Not all kinds of official identity documents are accepted for all countries. Check which documents can be submitted per country in the Requirements for natural persons.  
</Warning>  

## Best practices  

When uploading files, it is very important that the user respects the best practices below to ensure that the document can be read and verified.   

If any of the guidelines are not respected, it may result in an error or delay in processing the document.  

The document should be:

    <CardGroup cols={2}>

        <Card icon={IconGreenCheck}>
        One of the accepted documents from the country of issue
        </Card>

        <Card icon={IconGreenCheck}>
        Consistent with the information provided for the user
        </Card>
        
        <Card icon={IconGreenCheck}>
        For passports: one file (double-page spread) uploaded as one document page in one KYC Document.

        </Card>
        
        <Card icon={IconGreenCheck}>
        A color photo (rather than a scan from an image scanner, like a flatbed photocopier or a printer)
        </Card>
        
        <Card icon={IconGreenCheck}>
        Between 32KB and about 7MB (max. 10MB when encoded)
