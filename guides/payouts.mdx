A payout is the process of withdrawing funds from the Mangopay environment to an external bank account opened in the name of the Mangopay account holder.  

As detailed in the prerequisites below, the user must be verified (their `KYCLevel` must be `REGULAR`) and the bank account must be valid and in their name.  

## How Mangopay sends funds

How Mangopay sends a payout is determined by:  

##### 1. The user’s bank account and its type  

Bank accounts in the API have a different `Type` depending on the country of registration of the account, and different information is required for each to reflect local formats (see prerequisites below).  

The country of registration of a bank account is not linked to its currency. For example, a EUR payout to an account registered in the US requires a US-type account. A CAD payout to an account registered in Italy requires an IBAN-type account.  

##### 2. The currency of the payout  

Mangopay can send payouts in a wide range of currencies – see the <a href="/guides/currencies">currencies</a> page for details.

Receiving banks can be anywhere in the world. The currency of the payout combines with the account type to determine whether the bank wire is sent locally or internationally, which impacts processing times and costs.  

For more information, see the <a href="/guides/glossary#bank-wire">bank wire</a> glossary definition and <a href="https://mangopay.com/pricing">pricing</a> page.  

##### 3. The mode requested by the platform (if EUR in SEPA)  

If the payout is in EUR in the SEPA zone, platforms can choose to request an Instant Payout or not. There are two modes of payout:  
- Standard - For all currencies and all bank account types, a request to send funds by the quickest route available (see processing times below).  
- Instant payment - For EUR in SEPA (only), a request to send funds as an SEPA Instant Credit Transfer (in about 25 seconds, see instant payout below).  

## Basic flow  

Mangopay’s e-wallet system allows users of the Owner <a href="/guides/users/categories">category</a> to hold funds in their wallets. The user must be <a href="/guides/users/verification">verified</a> to withdraw funds to their bank account as a payout.  

The flow is as follows:  
- Ensure the Owner user is verified (`KYCLevel` is `REGULAR`)  
- Create a Bank Account to register their bank account  
- Create a Payout to request that Mangopay wire the funds  

<a href="/api-reference/payouts" class="btn Secondary normal">See payouts endpoints</a>  

Once the payout is successfully requested, its status becomes `CREATED`.  

You should set up <a href="/webhooks">hook notifications</a> for the following <a href="/webhooks/event-types">event types</a> to be notified of its progress:  
- PAYOUT_NORMAL_SUCCEEDED
- PAYOUT_NORMAL_FAILED  

The `SUCCEEDED` status indicates that Mangopay successfully processed the payout and sent the funds. There are some cases where the funds are returned by the receiving bank and Mangopay creates a payout refund (see below).  

In case of a `FAILED` status, you can use the <a href="/api-reference/payouts/view-payout">GET View a Payout</a> endpoint to see more information, particularly the `ResultCode` and `ResultMessage`. For more information on specific errors, see <a href="/errors/codes">Error codes</a>.

## Prerequisites  

### User verification  

Mangopay has legal obligations to verify the identity of users who wish to make payouts. Therefore, payouts can only be performed to bank accounts whose owner (as defined by the Bank Account object's User) is verified.   

If the user is not verified, the payout `Status` will automatically be set to `FAILED` after being processed by Mangopay. This processing usually takes a few seconds, but can be longer due to the amount or supplementary fraud checks.  

<Note>  
**Note - Payout `Status` may remain `CREATED`** 
  
In the production environment, a payout can remain with the `CREATED` status for longer than expected. This may be due to an uploaded KYC document still pending processing for the corresponding user.  
</Note>  

In addition, you should pay special attention to the identities of the payout author and bank account owner. Indeed, when the payout author is different from the bank account owner, the Payout `AuthorId` value must be different from the Bank Account `UserId` value as well. Otherwise, Mangopay’s Compliance team will reject the payout.  

### Bank accounts  

Different information is required for bank accounts in different countries. This is managed by the Bank Account `Type` parameter, which determines the information that needs to be provided via the dedicated endpoint. The values are:  
- IBAN - For accounts registered in countries that use IBAN  
- US - For accounts registered in the United States  
- CA - For accounts registered in Canada  
- GB - For accounts registered in the United Kingdom  
- OTHER - For accounts registered in countries that do not use IBAN (and are not US, CA, GB)  

The country of registration of a bank account is not linked to its currency.  

<Warning>  
**Caution - Creating the wrong type can lead to processing delays** 
  
Failure to use the correct type can lead to processing delays. Use the dedicated types for US, CA, and GB. Only use OTHER if the country isn’t one of these and doesn’t use IBAN.  
</Warning>  

For USD and CAD payouts made by a natural user, the Address of the author must be provided.  

For payments to GB accounts, the `OwnerName` must match either the `FirstName` and `LastName` of the corresponding natural user, or the ` Name` of the corresponding legal user.  

#### Country restrictions  

Due to <Aml content="AML" /> policy, we don’t accept the creation of bank accounts and payouts to some countries. Please refer to the <a href="/guides/users/country-restrictions">Country restrictions</a> article for more information.  

#### Minimum amount  

The payout minimum amount is €0.10 (or equivalent in other currencies). This is the default amount in Sandbox.  

It is not possible to make a payout inferior to €0.10, unless it is a payout made to empty a wallet. In other words, you can only make a €0.05 payout if the wallet balance is also €0.05.  

Note that the minimum amount might differ depending on the platform's contract with Mangopay.  

## Standard payout processing  

#### Cutoffs and processing times  

Standard payouts are processed by Mangopay as quickly as possible. Some payouts are subject to manual review by Mangopay’s teams for reasons of risk management or AML/CFT - these may take longer.  

Payouts created before the cutoff times outlined below are transferred to the user’s bank account within the corresponding processing times. Payouts created after the cutoff are processed next <WorkingDay content="working day" />.   

Cutoffs and processing times vary between currencies and target bank account types:

#### Faster Payments in the UK  

For GBP payouts to GB bank accounts, Mangopay sends them automatically via the Faster Payments System (FPS).  

The payout is usually processed in a matter of seconds (the `Status` changes from `CREATED` to `SUCCEEDED`) but there can be a delay of up to two hours. The service is available 24/7, 365 days of the year, so there is no cutoff for processing.  

## Payout refunds  

Successful payouts can be rejected by the acquiring bank (if the bank account is closed, or if it’s a savings account for instance), and this even if the payout `Status` is `SUCCEEDED`. In this case, Mangopay generates a Payout Refund request so that the funds can be returned to the wallet.  

We recommend you keep track of these refunds by setting up <a href="/webhooks">hook notifications</a> for the following <a href="/webhooks/event-types">event types</a>:  
- PAYOUT_REFUND_CREATED  
- PAYOUT_REFUND_SUCCEEDED  
- PAYOUT_REFUND_FAILED  

Additional information regarding the Payout Refund can be found in the `RefundReason` object returned by the API.  

Possible `RefundReasonType` are:  
- BANKACCOUNT_INCORRECT  
- BANKACCOUNT_HAS_BEEN_CLOSED  
- OWNER_DOT_NOT_MATCH_BANKACCOUNT  
- WITHDRAWAL_IMPOSSIBLE_ON_SAVINGS_ACCOUNTS  

The refund reason type may be accompanied by a custom message in the `RefundReasonMessage` parameter.
