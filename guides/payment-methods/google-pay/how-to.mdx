This how-to guide covers:   
- Setting up your Google Pay integration for use with Mangopay  
- Making payment requests.  

For an overview of the data flows, see the <a href="/guides/payment-methods/google-pay">Google Pay</a> guide. To integrate [Google Pay](/guides/payment-methods/google-pay) on your side, see the [Google Pay documentation](https://developers.google.com/pay/api).  

<Info>
**Prerequisites**
- A `ClientId` and an API key – you can create these in the <a href="https://hub.mangopay.com/" target="_blank">Mangopay Hub</a> (or else <a href="https://mangopay.com/contact" target="_blank">contact Sales</a> to get started)
- A User object created for your end user, and their associated Wallet
- Google Pay integrated in your <a href="https://developers.google.com/pay/api/web/overview" target="_blank">website</a> or <a href="https://developers.google.com/pay/api/android/overview" target="_blank">Android app</a>
- Google Pay activated for your `ClientId` by Mangopay (contact our teams <a href="https://hub.mangopay.com/" target="_blank">via the Hub</a>)

## 1. Configure your Google Pay integration for Mangopay  

When making payment requests to the Google Pay API, use the following values:  
- `gateway` - The payment gateway used: in this case, `whenthen`.  
- `gatewayMerchantId` - Your platform’s `ClientId` provided by Mangopay.  
- `allowedAuthMethods` - The supported authentication methods: `PAN_ONLY`, meaning the card is registered in the user’s Google account and requires additional 3DS authentication; `CRYPTOGRAM_3DS`, meaning the card is enrolled in the customer’s Google Wallet and authentication is handled by Google, with no 3DS redirection and no liability for the platform.  
- `allowedCardNetworks` - The card networks supported by Mangopay on Google Pay: only `VISA` and `MASTERCARD`.  
```json Google Pay configuration example
{
  "type": "CARD",
  "parameters": {
    "allowedAuthMethods": ["PAN_ONLY", "CRYPTOGRAM_3DS"],
    "allowedCardNetworks": ["MASTERCARD", "VISA"]
  },
  "tokenizationSpecification": {
    "type": "PAYMENT_GATEWAY",
    "parameters": {
      "gateway": "whenthen",
      "gatewayMerchantId": "your-mangopay-client-id"
    }
  }
}
```  

<Note>  
**Note - Ensure readiness of the rest of your Google Pay integration** 
  
Further integration steps are necessary to be able to offer Google Pay in your app or website, including creating the Google Pay button in line with their guidance.   

For more information, see the <a href="https://developers.google.com/pay/api" target="_blank">Google Pay documentation</a>.  
</Note>  

## 2. Include payment data in the pay-in call  

Include the payment data received from Google Pay for the payment as the value for the `PaymentData` parameter in your request to the <a href="/api-reference/google-pay/create-google-pay-payin">Create a Google Pay PayIn</a> endpoint.  

To be notified of the outcome, you can use the same webhook event types as for other pay-ins. The same pay-in functional errors are also possible.
