title: Card fingerprint
---

The card fingerprint is a unique identifier attached to each card on the platform, allowing you to spot unusual behavior.

The principle is as follows:

-   A card is registered with the Card Registration endpoint
-   Once the registration process is complete, the corresponding Card object is created
-   This Card object comes with a unique `Fingerprint`.

The same card can be registered several times in Mangopay, and will each time get a different `CardId`. The fingerprint, however, remains unique and this even across platforms.

You can take advantage of the following endpoints to spot unusual behaviors:

<CardGroup col={2}>
    <Card title="Endpoint" href="/api-reference/">
      List Cards for a Fingerprint
    </Card>

    <Card title="Endpoint" href="/api-reference/">
      List Transactions for a Card Fingerprint
    </Card>
</CardGroup>
