## Introduction  

Mangopay cards must be validated (`Validity` value is `VALID`) within 24 hours after the card registration. This can be done by making a successful pay-in with the card (direct, preauthorized, recurring, etc). See How to process a card payment for the complete flow of a one-off card payment.  

Alternatively - and particularly if the card is not going to be used within 24 hours - you can use the card validation feature to perform 3DS authentication without debiting the card.  

This guide focuses on how to perform a card validation.  

<Info>
**Prerequisites**

- A `ClientId` and an API key – you can create these in the <a href="https://hub.mangopay.com/" target="_blank">Mangopay Hub</a> (or else <a href="https://mangopay.com/contact" target="_blank">contact Sales</a> to get started)
- A User object created for your end user 
- A `CardId` for the end user’s card (`CardType` must be `CB_VISA_MASTERCARD`), obtained through the card registration flow or returned by the Mangopay [Vault SDK or Checkout SDK](/sdks/checkout) – in Sandbox, we recommend you use the [challenge test card](https://mangopay.com/docs/dev-tools/testing/payment-methods)
- The URL of a page on your platform to return the end user to after authentication
</Info>

## 1. Request the card validation  

Using the User’s `Id` as the `AuthorId`, use the [Create a Card Validation](/api-reference/card-validations/create-card-validation) endpoint to make the request for validation without a payment.  

When you make the card validation request, you also need to:  
- Be ready to handle 3DS authentication (Step 2)  
- Specify the page to which the user will be returned after authentication (Step 3)  

Read these steps before continuing.

## 2. Redirect the user to 3DS protocol (if required)  

Redirect the user to the `SecureModeRedirectURL` value to complete strong customer authentication.  

In the case of the Card Validation, it is highly unlikely that the value will be `null` (indicating that 3DS is not required and no redirection is needed).  

You can also use the `SecureModeNeeded` boolean to determine this redirection behavior.  

See the <a href="/guides/payment-methods/card/3ds">3DS</a> article for more information.  

<Note>  
**Note - Card validation expires after 5 minutes** 
  
Because you cannot create two requests at once for the same card, the card validation will expire after 5 minutes, setting the `Status` of the Card Validation object to `FAILED`.  

The Card `Validity`, however, will remain `UNKNOWN`, which allows you to request a new Card Validation.  
</Note>  

## 3. Redirect the user after authentication  

After the card validation, whatever the authentication outcome, the end user is returned to the `SecureModeReturnURL` which you defined.  

The Mangopay API returns your `SecureModeReturnURL` with the `Id` of the card validation attached as a query parameter in the following format:

> https<span>://www</span>.example.com?cardValidationId=`Id`

Mangopay updates the `Status` of the card validation to indicate the outcome of the end user's authentication.  

You can set up the following hooks to be notified of the outcome:

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th class="header">Name</th>
            <th class="header">ResourceId</th>
            <th class="header">Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td class="table-content">CARD_VALIDATION_CREATED</td>
            <td class="table-content">CardValidationId</td>
            <td class="table-content">The Card Validation object has been created and the card is pending validation.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="table-content">CARD_VALIDATION_FAILED</td>
            <td class="table-content">CardValidationId</td>
            <td class="table-content">The Card Validation has failed, setting the corresponding card as invalid.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="table-content">CARD_VALIDATION_SUCCEEDED</td>
            <td class="table-content">CardValidationId</td>
            <td class="table-content">The Card Validation has succeeded, setting the corresponding card as valid.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

## Handling errors  

The card validation endpoints contain HTTP error examples, such as when a card validation is already in progress or the card is already valid or invalid.  

In terms of functional errors, the card validation endpoints may return the same errors as other card pay-in requests.
