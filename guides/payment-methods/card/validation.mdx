**Availability:**
- `CB_VISA_MASTERCARD` only

A registered card must be validated within 24 hours of registration, otherwise its `Validity` is permanently set to `INVALID` and the card must be registered again.

Cards can be validated by a successful card flow:

- Direct card pay-in or recurring card pay-in (MIT) (authorization and debit)
- Preauthorization or deposit preauthorization (authorization and deferred debit)
- Card validation (authorization and no debit)

The card validation is a request for authentication only. It does not request capture of funds, and it is therefore not a [Transaction](/api-reference/transactions/transaction-object).


<Note>
    **Note - Card validation only available for CB_VISA_MASTERCARD** The card
    validation feature is only available for cards with the `CardType`
    `CB_VISA_MASTERCARD`
</Note>

## Benefits

For the platform:

-   Verifying that the card belongs to the user who registered it
-   Checking that the issuer authorizes the use of the card (for example, that it’s not blocked)

Because a card must be validated within 24 hours, the card validation feature allows greater flexibility in the user’s payment experience than a pay-in or preauthorization.

For the cardholder:

- Proving to platforms the card is theirs and is fit for use 
- No trace of the validation on their bank statement

## 3DS and card validation

A card validation may require 3DS authentication. It does not change the likelihood of SCA being required again later at the moment of payment with the card. 

Like with other card flows, the `SecureMode` parameter is available on card validation, which allows the platform to indicate a preference for 3DS authentication.

You can also use the `ValidationUsage` parameter to indicate the intended usage of the card. It has the values:

- CIT – For customer-initiated transactions (CITs), meaning 3DS is less likely to be required on the card validation.
- MIT – For merchant-initiated transactions (MITs), meaning 3DS is more likely to be required on the card validation.

You can set the `ValidationUsage` parameter to `CIT` to decrease the likelihood of SCA when the `SecureMode` value is `DEFAULT` or `NO_CHOICE`.

If the `SecureMode` value is `FORCE`, explicitly requesting SCA, then the `ValidationUsage` is set to `MIT` even if you send `CIT`.
