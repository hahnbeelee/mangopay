This how-to guide will show you how to successfully process recurring payments with a registered card.

<Info>
**Prerequisites**
- A `ClientId` and an API key – you can create these in the <a href="https://hub.mangopay.com/" target="_blank">Mangopay Hub</a> (or else <a href="https://mangopay.com/contact" target="_blank">contact Sales</a> to get started)
- A User object created for your end user, and their associated Wallet
- A <a href="/guides/payment-methods/card">registered card</a> (CB, Visa, or Mastercard), which is `VALID` or registered less than 24 hours ago, to make the payments
</Info>

Setting up a recurring card payment is necessary when the platform repeatedly charges the end user at regular intervals, such as in subscription models or payments in installments.  

A recurring card payment has two phases:  
- Customer-initiated transaction (CIT) - An initial transaction in the presence of the cardholder, for which <Sca content="SCA" /> is required.  
- Merchant-initiated transactions (MIT) - Subsequent transactions made in the absence of the cardholder, initiated by the platform (and not subject to SCA unless required by the <Issuer content="issuer" />)

<a href="/guides/payment-methods/card/recurring">Learn more about recurring card payments</a>  

## 1. Create the Recurring PayIn Registration  

The Recurring PayIn Registration object will define key information about the recurring payments such as:  
- The start and end date, as well as the frequency  
- Whether the amount is the same for each payment  
- Whether you want to offer zero-amount payments to your end user at the start of the recurrence (for example, during trial subscription offers)  

For this guide, we'll define a fixed monthly amount but not provide an end date.

  <PhpCreateRecurringPayinRegistration />
  <NodeCreateRecurringPayinRegistration />
  <RubyCreateRecurringRegistration />
  <PythonCreateRecurringPayinRegistration />
</CodeGroup>  

In the response, you will need the `Id` of the Recurring PayIn Registration for the next steps.

```  

## 2. Process the first recurring payment (CIT)  

### Make the request  

Request the first payment, linking it to the registration object by using the `Id` returned in the previous step as the `RecurringPayinRegistrationId`.  

In our example, the first transaction amounts have been defined at the registration level. Because of this, we don’t need to define the `DebitedFunds` or `Fees` at the pay-in level.

### Redirect the user to 3DS protocol  

The CIT transaction always requires 3DS (the `SecureModeNeeded` value is set to true), so you need to redirect the end user to the `SecureModeRedirectURL` value to complete the authentication.  

For more information on how to handle 3DS redirection, see Steps 6 and 7 of the <a href="/guides/payment-methods/card/direct/how-to">How to process a card payment</a> guide.  

## 3. Process the subsequent recurring payments (MIT) at the defined intervals  

Once the first pay-in has been successfully authorized, the platform can initiate payments without the end user being present to authenticate (but note that, at any time, the issuer may request SCA - see Step 5).  

Create the recurring pay-in at the set interval with the dedicated endpoint. Note that in our example, we didn’t define the next transaction amounts at the registration level. As a consequence, we need to pass the `DebitedFunds` and `Fees` parameters at the pay-in level.

  <PhpCreateRecurringPayinMit />
  <NodeCreateRecurringPayinMit />
  <RubyCreateRecurringPayinMit />
  <PythonCreateARecurringPayinMit />
</CodeGroup>  

## 4. Update the registration (if required)  

Some information regarding the recurring registration may be modified during the recurrence:  
- `CardId` - Changing this will require a new CIT for SCA  
- `Billing` and `Shipping`  

Use the Update a Recurring PayIn Registration endpoint to modify these details.  

## 5. Handle re-authentication (when required)  

At any moment during the recurrence, the issuer may request that the end user authenticates again. This also occurs when changing the `CardId` in the Recurring PayIn Registration (see Step 4).  

Set up a hook notification for the following `EventType` to be notified when re-authentication is needed:  
- RECURRING_REGISTRATION_AUTH_NEEDED  

In this case, you need to guide the end user through authentication during a new CIT in the same way as Step 2.  

## 6. Check the recurring payments' current state  

The `CurrentState` of the Recurring PayIn Registration provides key information about the recurring payments:  
- Number of pay-ins made against the registration  
- Cumulated amounts of debited funds and fees  
- Last pay-in made against the registration  

Use View a Recurring PayIn Registration endpoint to get this information.

        "Amount": 100
    },
    "NextTransactionDebitedFunds": null,
    "NextTransactionFees": null,
    "Migration": false
}
```  

## 7. End the recurring payments  

Recurring payments may come to an end either automatically (when an `EndDate` was defined) or because the end user requests it.  

To end the recurring payments manually, use the Update a Recurring Registration endpoint to change the `Status` to `ENDED`. 

> [**PUT** /v2.01/&lcub;ClientId&rcub;/recurringpayinregistrations/&lcub;RecurringPayinRegistrationId&rcub;](/api-reference/recurring-card-payins/update-recurring-payin-registration)

<CodeGroup>  
  <RestUpdateRecurringPayinRegistration />
  <PhpUpdateRecurringPayinRegistration />
  <NodeUpdateRecurringPayinRegistration />
  <RubyUpdateRecurringRegistration />
  <PythonUpdateRecurringPayinRegistration />
</CodeGroup>  

When you do this, no more recurring pay-ins can be created based on the registration.  

Set up a hook notification for the following `EventType` to be notified when a registration is ended by the end user:  
- RECURRING_REGISTRATION_ENDED
