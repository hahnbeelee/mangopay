## User prerequisites

To use this payment method, users must:  
- Download the Satispay app and sign up, thereby registering their phone number  
- Connect their bank account in the app  

## How it works  
- On your app or website, the user selects Satispay as the payment method during checkout  
- The user is redirected to the `RedirectURL`  
- The user scans a QR code or enters their phone number  
- The QR code or a push notification prompts the user to open the Satispay app and authenticate themselves  
- The user validates the amount to pay  
- The user is returned to your app or website on the `ReturnURL`  

### Outcome

The transaction is complete when the pay-in status changed from `CREATED` to `SUCCEEDED` or `FAILED`, indicating the outcome.  

You should also set up [hook notifications](/webhooks) for the relevant [event types](/webhooks/event-types):
-   PAYIN_NORMAL_SUCCEEDED
-   PAYIN_NORMAL_FAILED
