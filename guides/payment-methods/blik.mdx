## How it works  

1. On your app or website, the user selects BLIK as the payment method during checkout.
2. The user opens their banking app where they find a six-digit code generated.
3. The user copies the code and returns to your app or website.
4. The user enters the code to validate the payment.
5. The platform makes an API call with `Code`.
6. The user is redirected to their banking app.
7. The user enters their banking app PIN to confirm the payment. 
8. The user is returned to your app or website.

### BLIK OneClick

BLIK then gives users the option to save the merchant (that is, your platform) so future payments can be processed without the temporary 6-digit code â€“ this is known as BLIK OneClick.

There are two options to save a merchant:

- Option 1: On the payment confirmation page, the user clicks _Save the shop_.
- Option 2: After entering their card PIN, the user clicks _Pay and save_ to simultaneously confirm the payment and save the merchant. 

Once the merchant is saved, the user sees 2 buttons. They can choose the basic flow by clicking _BLIK with code_, or they can click _BLIK without code_ to use OneClick.

The OneClick flow uses the <a href="/api-reference/blik/create-blik-payin-without-code">POST Create a BLIK PayIn (without code)</a> endpoint:

1. On your app or website, the user selects _BLIK without code_ during checkout.
2. The user is redirected to their banking app.
3. The user enters their card PIN to confirm the payment. 

For more information, see the [BLIK Level 0 + OneClick](https://blik.com/lp/payment-without-code/Level_0_%2B_OneClick.html) article on the BLIK documentation.

## Hooks

The transaction is complete when the pay-in status changed from `CREATED` to `SUCCEEDED` or `FAILED`, indicating the outcome.  

You should also set up [hook notifications](/webhooks) for the relevant [event types](/webhooks/event-types):

- PAYIN_NORMAL_SUCCEEDED  
- PAYIN_NORMAL_FAILED
