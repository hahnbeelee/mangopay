Title: Apple Pay – How it works

order: App / website, Platform, Mangopay API

App / website -> Apple Pay API: Request payment 
Apple Pay API --> App / website: Return PaymentData
App / website -> Platform: Send PaymentData
Platform -> Mangopay API: POST Create PayIn with PaymentData
Mangopay API --> Platform: Return PayIn status
Platform -> App / website: Send outcome

*/}

1. The user selects Apple Pay at the checkout on your app or website and confirms payment
2. Your app or website makes the payment request to Apple Pay
3. Apple Pay returns the encrypted payment data token, which includes details about the purchase
4. Your app or website passes the payment data to your platform’s backend
5. Your platform includes the payment data in it’s pay-in request to Mangopay
6. Mangopay returns the transaction result
7. Your platform confirms the outcome to the user

<Note>
    **Note - 3DS redirection not required for Apple Pay** 
    
    With Apple Pay, SCA-compliant authentication is handled by the user’s device (iPhone or
    Mac), meaning that the payment data received from Apple Pay is already
    authenticated and no 3DS redirection is required.
</Note>

### Outcome

The transaction is complete when the pay-in status changes from `CREATED` to `SUCCEEDED` or `FAILED`, indicating the outcome.

You should also set up [hook notifications](/webhooks) for the relevant [event types](/webhooks/event-types):
-   PAYIN_NORMAL_SUCCEEDED
-   PAYIN_NORMAL_FAILED


## Activation
Apple Pay requires certification from Apple Pay and activation by Mangopay before it can be used. See <a href="/guides/payment-methods/apple-pay/how-to">How to process an Apple Pay payment</a> for more information.
