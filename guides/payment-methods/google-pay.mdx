Title: Google Pay – How it works

order: App / website, Platform, Mangopay API

App / website -> Google Pay API: Request payment 
Google Pay API --> App / website: Return PaymentData
App / website -> Platform: Send PaymentData
Platform -> Mangopay API: POST Create PayIn with PaymentData
Mangopay API --> Platform: Return PayIn
Platform -> App / website: Redirect for 3DS or send outcome

*/}

- The user selects Google Pay at the checkout on your app or website and confirms payment  
- Your app or website makes the payment request to Google Pay  
- Google Pay returns the encrypted payment data token, which includes details about the purchase.  
- Your app or website passes the payment data to your platform’s backend  
- Your platform includes the payment data in it’s request to Mangopay  
- Mangopay changes the status of the pay-in  
- Your platform confirms the outcome or redirects the end user for 3DS authentication  

The transaction is complete when the pay-in status changed from `CREATED` to `SUCCEEDED` or `FAILED`, indicating the outcome.  

You should also set up [hook notifications](/webhooks) for the relevant [event types](/webhooks/event-types):
-   PAYIN_NORMAL_SUCCEEDED
-   PAYIN_NORMAL_FAILED
