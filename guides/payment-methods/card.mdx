## Card registration

Processing card payments with Mangopay involves passing sensitive card details to a dedicated tokenization server to generate a `CardId`.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Initiate card tokenization">
        Call the <a href="/api-reference/card-registrations/create-card-registration" target="_blank">POST Create a Card Registration</a> endpoint to initiate the flow and obtain a secure URL to which you can send card details.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Tokenize the card">
        Send the cardholder's sensitive data directly to the tokenization server, without passing yours or Mangopay's, thanks to the <a href="/api-reference/card-registrations/tokenize-card" target="_blank">POST Tokenize the card</a> endpoint.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Update the card registration object">
        Send the `RegistrationData` received from the tokenization server via <a href="/api-reference/card-registrations/update-card-registration">PUT Update a Card Registration</a> to generate a `CardId`.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Use the card object for a payment flow">
        Use the `CardId` to call the Mangopay API to initiate a one-time, recurring, or preauthorized card payment flow.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Deactivate the card">
        Deactivate the card if you don't have the user's permission to save their payment details. You can follow the same tokenization process for a future payment. 
    </Step>
</Steps>

This process involves two distinct API objects:  
- <a href="/api-reference/card-registrations/card-registration-object">Card Registration</a> - The object to safely tokenize the card and create the Card object.
- <a href="/api-reference/cards/card-object">Card</a> - The tokenized version of the card, whose `CardId` will allow you to make payments.

For more detailed guidance, see the <a href="/guides/payment-methods/card/direct/how-to">how-to guide for one-time payments</a>.

    **Best practice – Use Checkout SDK**

    The Mangopay Checkout SDK takes care of card tokenization for you, and simplifies your integration for cards and other payment methods.

## 3DS

Redirection for cardholder authentication, using the <a href="/guides/payment-methods/card/3ds">3DS protocol</a>, is applicable to all card payment flows.

## Refunds

Refunds are supported on all card brands and for all pay-in flows. For more information, see the [Refunds](/guides/refunds) guide.

## Chargebacks and disputes

All card pay-ins may be subject to a chargeback, which is when the end user opposes a payment with their issuing bank. When a chargeback occurs, a dispute is created which may be contestable. For more information, see the [Disputes](/guides/disputes) guide.
