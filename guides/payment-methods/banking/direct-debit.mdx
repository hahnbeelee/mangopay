## Introduction  

Direct debit is a way of processing payments by pulling funds from the end user’s bank account directly to a <Wallet content="wallet" />.  

In order to process direct debits, Mangopay relies on a mandate, which is an agreement from the end user allowing a third party to collect the payment in the future.  

This payment method is particularly popular for subscriptions for instance.  

The following schemes are supported: 

<CardGroup cols={2}>  
    <Card title="BACS">  
        Scheme specific to the UK, which only supports GBP pay-ins. A GB-type Bank Account is required to create this mandate.  
    </Card>  
    <Card title="SEPA">  
        Scheme specific to the Eurozone, which only supports EUR. An IBAN-type Bank Account is required to create this mandate.  
    </Card>  
</CardGroup>  

<Note>  
**Note - Payment method activation** 
  
Mandates and direct debit pay-ins are only available for certain business types and are not activated by default.  

Please contact Mangopay’s Support team <a href="https://hub.mangopay.com/" target="_blank">via the Hub</a> to activate this payment method.  
</Note>  

## Direct debit payment flow  

### Process  

Processing direct debit pay-ins requires three steps:  
- Create a Bank Account object belonging either to the BACS network (GB-type Bank Account) or SEPA network (IBAN-type Bank Account).  
- Create the Mandate object and have the end user confirm it.  
- Make a Direct Direct-Debit PayIn once the mandate is active.  

As agreed with the end user, until the mandate is either:  
- Canceled - The end user or the platform has canceled the mandate. This results in the `Status` of the Mandate object being set to `FAILED`.  
- Expired - No pay-ins were made against the mandate in the last 24 months, which makes it expire. This results in the `Status` of the Mandate object being set to `EXPIRED`.  

<Note>  
**Note - Mandate activation** 
  
Once the end user confirms the mandate, its `Status` changes to `SUBMITTED`, meaning that it has been submitted to the end user’s bank. It will become `ACTIVE`:  
- After a few days (usually 3) for the BACS scheme.  
- After the first direct debit pay-in for the SEPA scheme.  
</Note>  

### Pay-in processing time  

Direct debit pay-ins are not instantaneous, there will always be a delay between the moment the transaction is `CREATED` until it reaches the `SUCCEEDED` status.  

While such delays can vary, you can find in the table below the usual number of business days to reach each step of the pay-in process.

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th class="header">Scheme</th>
            <th class="table-content">SEPA</th>

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th class="header">Payment `SUCCEEDED`</th>
            <td class="table-content">D+5</td>
            <td class="table-content">
                - D+6 (first payment against the mandate)
                - D+5 (subsequent payments against the mandate)
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table> 

### BACS scheme specificities  

When using a BACS scheme mandate, please note that:  
- Confirmation pages and emails are only available in English, regardless of the `Culture` parameter value.  
- When the mandate is confirmed, an email is automatically sent by Mangopay on the platform’s behalf.  
- NatWest, RBS, HSBC, Metro, and Nationwide banks don’t show the platform trading name on bank statements; only Mangopay is displayed.  
- Mandates can't be created on accounts where multiple signatures are required (e.g. business accounts).  

## Late failures and chargebacks  

Late failures can occur for direct debit due to the payment method flow: even if the direct debit pay-in was successful, the <Issuer content="issuing bank" /> can pull back the funds.  

When a late failure happens, Mangopay automatically creates a Dispute object (as well as the corresponding Repudiation transaction) in the same way as for a regular <Chargeback content="chargeback" />.  

The Dispute `DisputeReasonType` parameter displays one of the late failure-related reasons:  
- LATE_FAILURE_BANKACCOUNT_CLOSED  
- LATE_FAILURE_BANKACCOUNT_INCOMPATIBLE  
- LATE_FAILURE_BANKACCOUNT_INCORRECT  
- LATE_FAILURE_CONTACT_USER  
- LATE_FAILURE_INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS

<Note>  
**Note - It is not possible to cumulate disputes and refunds** 
  
If a Refund was made on for the direct debit pay-in, no Dispute can be created for the pay-in as it was already refunded.  
In the same way, if a Dispute has already been created for a direct debit pay-in, no Refund can be created.  
</Note>  

Usually, late failures occur:  
- Within 2 or 3 days for the BACS scheme.  
- Within 5 days for the SEPA scheme  

Chargebacks are always non-contestable and are still possible:  
- Indefinitely for the BACS scheme.  
- Up to 8 weeks for the SEPA scheme.  

<Check>  
**Best practice - Make sure you wait prior to doing a refund** 
  
To avoid conflicts between a refund and a chargeback, we recommend waiting at least 8 business days following a successful transaction prior to processing a refund.
