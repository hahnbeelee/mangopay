## User prerequisites

To use this payment method, users must:  
- Download the MB WAY app and sign up, thereby registering their phone number and creating a PIN code  
- Connect their bank account in the app  

## How it works  
- On your app or website, the user selects MB WAY as the payment method during checkout and enters their phone number in the `Phone` parameter  
- The user receives a push notification to open the MB WAY app on their phone  
- The user chooses their preferred card and confirms the payment details  
- The user authenticates themselves using their MB WAY app PIN  

The transaction is complete when the pay-in status changes from `CREATED` to `SUCCEEDED` or `FAILED`, indicating the outcome.  

You should also set up [hook notifications](/webhooks) for the relevant [event types](/webhooks/event-types):
-   PAYIN_NORMAL_SUCCEEDED
-   PAYIN_NORMAL_FAILED
