<Warning>
**Warning – Giropay no longer available after June 30, 2024**

Giropay’s operator Paydirekt has decided to cease the payment method’s services at the end of June, without providing a direct alternative. This decision by Paydirekt impacts the entire industry and is beyond our control.

Effective July 1, 2024: 
- Pay-ins will fail with the <a href="/errors/codes/101101">101101</a> error
- Refunds will be possible for one year 

This change affects both the <a href="/api-reference/giropay">new</a> and <a href="/api-reference/web-direct-debit-payins">legacy</a> integrations.

Our team is ready to assist you with your integration of alternatives like <a href="/guides/payment-methods/klarna">Klarna</a>, <a href="/guides/payment-methods/paypal">PayPal</a>, or <a href="/guides/payment-methods/banking/virtual-iban">virtual IBANs</a> for the German market.

## How it works  
- On your app or website, the user selects Giropay as the payment method during checkout.  
- The user is redirected to the Giropay payment page `RedirectURL` where they enter their bank identifier code (BIC).  
- The user logs in to their banking interface.  
- The user chooses between using a QR code or entering a transaction authentication number (TAN).  
- After authentication, the user chooses which bank account to debit.  

The transaction is complete when the pay-in status changes from `CREATED` to `SUCCEEDED` or `FAILED`, indicating the outcome.  

You should also set up <a href="/webhooks">hook notifications</a> fo the relevant <a href="/webhooks/event-types">relevant types</a>:  
- PAYIN_NORMAL_SUCCEEDED  
- PAYIN_NORMAL_FAILED  

<Note>  
**Note - Minimum amount** 
  
The minimum accepted amount for Giropay pay-ins is €1.00 (`100`).  

In Production, pay-ins lower than this amount will fail.  
</Note>
