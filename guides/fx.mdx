Mangopay provides foreign exchange (forex, FX) services within the Mangopay environment.  

Mangopay relies on a dedicated transaction type, conversion, to enable platforms to convert funds between wallets of different currencies.  

There are two types of conversion, corresponding to Mangopay’s two FX offerings: 

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th class="header">Instant&nbsp;conversion –&nbsp;Spot&nbsp;FX</th>
<th class="header">Quoted&nbsp;conversion –&nbsp;Guaranteed&nbsp;FX</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="table-content">
Instantly convert funds at the current market rate. The rate used is returned in the conversion response, and an indicative rate is available at any time.

Spot FX is a one-step feature:
* <a href="/api-reference/conversions/create-instant-conversion">Create an Instant Conversion</a>
</td>
<td class="table-content">
Convert funds against a quote, which locks in the conversion rate for a pre-agreed duration. One quote defines the rate and currency pair for one conversion, which must be made before the duration expires.

Guaranteed FX is a two-step process:
1. <a href="/api-reference/quotes/create-quote">Create a Quote</a>
2. <a href="/api-reference/conversions/create-quoted-conversion">Create a Quoted Conversion</a>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

An indicative rate for a currency pair is available at any time using the [View an indicative Conversion Rate](/api-reference/conversion-rates/view-conversion-rate) endpoint.  

### Constraints  

Conversions (of both types):  
- Must take place between two wallets owned by the same user  
- Can’t be refunded: another conversion with the reverse currency pair must be created  

Quotes:  
- Can only be made for a duration pre-agreed between Mangopay and the platform  
- Can only be used once  
- Can’t be used once they expire  
- Don’t have to be used once created  

Fees can only be set at creation of a quote and an instant conversion. The fees are taken before the conversion takes place, in the currency of the debited funds.

## Rates  

The conversion rate offered by Mangopay is expressed in two ways, both as decimal numbers:  
- `MarketRate` - The market rate is used to convert funds during a conversion using the formula: `DebitedFunds` `Amount` * `MarketRate` = `CreditedFunds` `Amount`. The market rate fluctuates in line with FX market dynamics and is common to all platforms for the currency pair.  
- `ClientRate` - The client rate includes Mangopay’s markup: it is indicative of the rate invoiced during the billing cycle. `ClientRate` = `MarketRate` * (1 - markup).The `ClientRate` fluctuates in line with the `MarketRate`.  

Mangopay's markup is agreed during contracting. You can can calculate it using the formula:  
- Markup = 1 - (`ClientRate` / `MarketRate`)  

## Currencies  

Mangopay is able to offer a wide range of currencies for FX services (both Spot FX and Guaranteed FX) – see the <a href="/guides/currencies">currencies</a> page for details.

If Mangopay doesn't currently support a currency you are looking to use, contact us <a href="https://hub.mangopay.com/" target="_blank">via the Hub</a> or the <a href="https://mangopay.com/contact" target="_blank">Sales contact form</a> to register your interest. 

<Note>

In Production, foreign exchange services are subject to a contract amendment.   

In Sandbox, the features and their specificities (currencies and quote durations) require activation for your API credentials.

## Use cases  

### User store and convert  

You can offer FX services to your users from within your platform thanks to Mangopay’s wallet-based FX services. This enables your users to request payouts in a different currency, as well as re-use their funds on your platform for transactions in other currencies.  

The flow is as follows:  
1. [Create a Wallet](/api-reference/wallets/create-wallet) in each currency for your user  
2. Show the user an approximate conversion rate using the [View an indicative Conversion Rate](/api-reference/conversion-rates/view-conversion-rate) endpoint  
3. If they wish to proceed with the currency exchange, [Create an Instant Conversion](/api-reference/conversions/create-instant-conversion) to convert the funds  

The indicative rate presented and the actual rate converted may differ slightly, so you need to communicate this to the user.  

A similar flow is possible using quoted conversions. The flow is as follow: 

1. [Create a Wallet](/api-reference/wallets/create-wallet) in each currency for your user.
2. Show the user an indicative conversion rate using the [View an indicative Conversion Rate](/api-reference/conversion-rates/view-conversion-rate) endpoint.
3. [Create a Quote](/api-reference/quotes/create-quote) to freeze a conversion rate, for a given currency pair, for a duration of time. You need to communicate the duration to the user.
4. If they wish to proceed with the currency conversion, [Create a Quoted Conversion](/api-reference/conversions/create-quoted-conversion) to convert the funds using an active quote. If the quote has expired, create the quote again (Step 3).

### Multi-currency pricing  

You can list product prices in the user’s local currency before they pay.  

For example, a European marketplace can list EUR products in GBP for the UK market.  

The flow is as follows:  
1. Display approximate GBP prices on product pages using the [View an indicative Conversion Rate](/api-reference/conversion-rates/view-conversion-rate) endpoint, refreshing every few minutes  
2. When the buyer proceeds to checkout, [Create a Quote](/api-reference/quotes/create-quote) (GBPEUR) to guarantee their GBP price for the quote duration  
3. Create a GBP pay-in to the buyer’s GBP wallet  
4. [Create a Quoted Conversion](/api-reference/conversions/create-quoted-conversion) to convert the funds to the buyer’s EUR wallet  

Both the pay-in and conversion needs to happen before the quote expires, so you should trigger the conversion on the successful pay-in.  

If the quote expires before the buyer completes their checkout, then you can refresh the quote and display a new guaranteed price.  

## Managing conversions  

The [View a Conversion](/api-reference/conversions/view-conversion) endpoint returns both instant and quoted conversions.  
- For an instant conversion, the `QuoteId` is `null`.  
- For a quoted conversion, the `QuoteId` contains the unique identifier of the quote against which the conversion was requested  

The conversion transaction behaves like other transactions, meaning it appears in the following endpoints:  
- [List Transactions for a User](/api-reference/transactions/list-transactions-user)  
- [List Transactions for a Wallet](/api-reference/transactions/list-transactions-wallet)  
- [Create a Transactions Report](/api-reference/reports/create-transactions-report)
