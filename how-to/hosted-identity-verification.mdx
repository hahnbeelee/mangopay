Mangopay's hosted identity verification session allows platforms to redirect a user to a Mangopay-hosted digital experience in which the user provides details and documents to verify their identity.

<Note>
**Note – Hosted identity verification only available for Legal Soletraders**

The hosted identity verification feature is only available for Legal users whose `LegalPersonType` is `SOLETRADER`.

The user must also be an Owner to request identity verification.

## Endpoints

### POST Create a hosted Identity Verification Session

This endpoint allows you to initiate an identity verification session for a user and obtain a redirection link for their Mangopay-hosted experience.

``` json POST /users/{UserId}/identity-verifications
{
  "ReturnUrl": "https://your-return-url.com",
  "Tag": "Custom data"
}
```

<Accordion title="See parameter details">
### Path parameters
<UserId />
### Body parameters
<ReturnURL4 />
<Tag3/>

### Responses
<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="200 - Session pending">
        <IdResponse />
        <Tag2Response />
        <CreationDateResponse />
        <HostedUrlResponse />
        <Status13Response />
        <ReturnURL3Response />

    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="400 - User must have UserCategory value OWNER">
    
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
</Accordion>

**API response**

``` json 200 - Session pending
{
  "Id": "32197520",
  "Tag": "Custom data",
  "CreationDate": 1710402969,
  "HostedUrl": "https://example.com",
  "Status": "PENDING",
  "ReturnUrl": "https://your-return-url.com"
}
```

In response, the API returns the `HostedUrl` to which you need to redirect the user to complete their identity verification.

The `Status` parameter indicates the progression of the verification session:

- **VALIDATED** – The session was successful.
- **REJECTED** – The session was unsuccessful.
- **OUTDATED** – The session is no longer valid (likely due to expired documents used during the session).
- **TIMEOUT** – The session timed out due to inactivity.
- **PENDING** – The session is in progress and user action is required to complete it.
- **REVIEW** – The session is under manual review by Mangopay.
- **ERROR** – The session was not completed because an error occurred.

**HTTP errors**

The user must have the `UserCategory` value `OWNER` to enable a verification request for them.

``` json 400 - User must have UserCategory value OWNER
{
  "Message": "This feature is only available for users categorised as Owner.",
  "Type": "invalid_action",
  "Id": "0ecdeb35-c34b-489b-92ee-a1a5f9062ee5",
  "Date": 1710955348.0,
  "errors": null
}
```

### GET View an Identity Verification session

This endpoint lets you view the details of an Identity Verification session using its `Id` as the `IdentityVerificationId` path parameter.

``` json GET /v2.01/{ClientId}/identity-verifications/{IdentityVerificationId}
// GET has no body parameters
```

<Accordion>
### Path parameters
<IdentityVerificationId />

### Responses
</Accordion>

**API response**

``` json
{
  "Id": "32197520",
  "Tag": "Custom data",
  "CreationDate": 1710402969,
  "HostedUrl": "https://example.com",
  "Status": "VALIDATED",
  "ReturnUrl": "https://your-return-url.com"
}
```

## Webhooks

You can set up [webhook notifications](/webhooks) for following event types relating to the identity verification session:

- **IDENTITY_VERIFICATION_PENDING** – The identity verification session is in progress and requires further action from the user to complete.
- **IDENTITY_VERIFICATION_VALIDATED** – The identity verification session was successful. 
- **IDENTITY_VERIFICATION_FAILED** – The identity verification session was unsuccessful. You can retry the verification for the user.  
- **IDENTITY_VERIFICATION_OUTDATED** – The identity verification session is no longer valid, likely due to expired documents used during the session.
- **IDENTITY_VERIFICATION_TIMEOUT** – The identity verification session was not completed within the allocated time. The session cannot be resumed and a new session must be initiated.
- **IDENTITY_VERIFICATION_REVIEW** – The identity verification session is undergoing additional manual review by Mangopay.

The `ResourceId` of these webhooks corresponds to the `IdentityVerificationId`.

These event types complement the existing ones relating to the user's KYCLevel:

- **USER_KYC_REGULAR** – The user has been successfully verified by Mangopay, either using the hosted experience or through submission of KYC Documents.
- **USER_KYC_LIGHT** – The user has not been verified by Mangopay and is therefore subject to product limitations for AML purposes.
