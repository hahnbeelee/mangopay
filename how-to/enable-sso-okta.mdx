Single sign-on (SSO) lets your team members authenticate their access to the Mangopay Hub via a third-party identity provider.  

Setting up SSO can help simplify access management and increase security by enforcing standards.  

<Note>  
**Note - Enabling SSO replaces previous credentials** 
  
If you decide to set up SSO, Hub users will no longer be able to authenticate using their previously created passwords.  
</Note>  
<Note>
**Note – Hub 2FA cannot be deactivated**

The two-factor authentication (2FA) of the Hub cannot be deactivated under any circumstances.\
Okta allows you to deactivate 2FA for a particular app, such as the Hub, so you can simplify the experience and rely on Mangopay's feature, which will always remain in place.
</Note>

## 1. Configure Okta for Mangopay  

In Okta, go to _Applications_ > _Browse App Catalog_.  

- Search for the Mangopay app and add it.  
- Assign the users or groups that will be able to log in to Mangopay.  

In the Okta Mangopay app, go to the _General_ tab.  

- Scroll down to the Client Credentials section.
- Note the Okta Client ID and Okta Client Secret.

## 2. Contact Mangopay  

Contact the Mangopay Support team [via the Hub](https://hub.mangopay.com/) (category: _My platform account_ > _Hub and dashboard_).

Set the subject as:

- Okta SSO activation

Include the following information:  
- Okta domain (example.okta.com)  
- Okta Client ID  
- Okta Client Secret  

## 3. Await confirmation that the Okta Mangoapy app is connected 

Once Mangopay activates the Okta SSO for your application, you will receive a confirmation email.

## 4. Manually assign users in Okta 

Now that the Okta Mangopay app has been enabled and connected, provision the users in Okta by assigning them to the app. This enables them to use Okta to connect to the Hub.

The user must already be created in Okta. If not the case, create the user before assigning them.

<Note>
**Note – Users are not automatically provisioned** 

Users assigned to the Okta Mangopay app integration are not automatically provisioned once it is connected. You need to assign them manually after Mangopay confirms the activation (in Step 3).
</Note>

## 5. Instruct your users to log in with Okta

Inform your users they can now log in using Okta.

The sign-in process is initiated from Hub login page as before. The user needs to:

1. Navigate to the [Hub login screen](https://hub.mangopay.com/) in their browser.
2. Enter their Okta credentials and click "Sign in with Okta". The user is redirected to their Hub welcome screen.
