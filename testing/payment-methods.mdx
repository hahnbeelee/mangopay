## Banking

### Mandates

For mandates testing, you can set a specific value for the `FirstName` parameter of the user who owns the bank account for the mandate.

- `Successful` - Results in an active mandate. You must do a pay-in with this mandate for the Status to be updated.
- `Invalid` - Results in a failed mandate due to incorrect bank account information. This only works for mandates in the BACS scheme.
- `Penniless` - Results in a failed pay-in due to lack of funds. Please refer to the 001805 error for all the testing steps.
- `Fickle` - Results in a successful pay-in which is disputed by the user and hence a dispute is created.

### SEPA Direct Debit

The following IBAN bank account information can be used for testing:

<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th class="header">**`IBAN`**</th>
