Some of Mangopay’s endpoints support filtering and sorting features based on a given object’s parameters. This can prove useful to look for specific information and to improve performance.  

You can use query parameters to define the values by which to filter or sort information returned by the API.  

**Filtering query string example:**

> …/users/154876/transactions?Status=Succeeded,Failed&Type=Payin,Payout

**Sorting query string example:**

> …/users?Sort=CreationDate:ASC
