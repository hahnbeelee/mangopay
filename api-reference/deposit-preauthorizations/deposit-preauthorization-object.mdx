### Description
The Deposit Preauthorization object enables you to reserve funds on a card so they can be captured later. A deposit preauthorization thus has two parts:  
- Authorization of the transaction, handled by the Deposit Preauthorization object  
- Capture of the funds, handled by the Deposit Preauthorized PayIn object  

The preauthorized funds can be captured within 29.5 days of a successful authorization.   

Note that preauthorizations may not be permitted by some issuers and for some card types.  

The Deposit Preauthorization feature also allows you to charge a complement against it, either on top of the preauthorized amount or instead of it (by declaring a no-show).    

<Warning>  
**Caution â€“ Multi-capture not possible with the Deposit Preauthorization** 
  
A maximum of two captures are possible against a Deposit Preauthorization: (i) the initial pay-in to capture the preauthorized amount, and/or (ii) a pay-in complement to capture an additional amount.   

Multiple partial captures are not possible with the Deposit Preauthorization like they are with the Preauthorization object.  
</Warning>
