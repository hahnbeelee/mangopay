### Description
The Card object is the virtual and secured version (i.e., the tokenized version) of a card that can be used to make a payment.  

The card object is created upon successfully completing the card registration process. The same actual card can be registered several times for security and privacy purposes. As a consequence, for a single real-life card, multiple Card objects can be created in the Mangopay environment.  

<Warning>  
**Caution â€“ Card validation within 24 hours** 
  
A successful transaction (preauthorization, pay-in, or recurring) or card validation within 24 hours of the card registration is required to validate a card. Otherwise, the card becomes invalid and a new card registration will be necessary.  
</Warning>
