### Description

Mangopay  relies on the Card Registration object to safely tokenize a card and create the [Card](/api-reference/cards/card-object) object.  

Successfully registering a card to create the Card object is a multiple-step process. It is necessary to process card payments (direct, preauthorized, and recurring card pay-ins) or validate the card.  

<Note>  
**Note – Card validation within 24 hours** 
  
A successful transaction (preauthorization, pay-in, or recurring) or card validation within 24 hours of the card registration is required to validate a card. Otherwise, the card becomes invalid and a new card registration will be necessary.  
</Note>  

<Warning>  
**Warning – End user approval** 
  
Under no circumstances should card information be kept without the end user's approval. If you don’t have the end user’s approval, you need to deactivate the card.  
</Warning>  

<Tip>
    **Best practice – Use Checkout SDK**

    Simplify payments by card and other payment methods with the Mangopay [Checkout SDK](/sdks/checkout).
