### Description
The Client Wallet object represents one of two wallets created automatically by Mangopay for each currency:  
- Fees Wallet - Stores all `Fees` taken on transactions (see the <a href="/guides/fees">Fees</a> guide for more information). The `FundsType` of the Fees Wallet is `FEES`.  
- Repudiation Wallet - Manages funds relating to <a href="/guides/disputes">disputes management</a>. The `FundsType` of the Repudiation Wallet is `CREDIT`.  

There can be only one wallet per `FundsType` and `Currency`.  

<Note>  
**Note â€“ Latency of balance update** 
  
The client wallet balance can take a few minutes to be updated after a transfer with fees has been done.
