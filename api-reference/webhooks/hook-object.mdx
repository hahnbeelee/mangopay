### Description
A webhook is a technical approach that allows Mangopay to submit a notification to other applications whenever a specific event occurs.  

The Hook object allows you to receive notifications, to a URL you define, that are triggered by a specific event type. You can set up only one URL for each event type.

**Best practice â€“ Idempotent hook processing** 
  
The retry feature (i.e., new notification if your app was unreachable) can set the hook to `INVALID`. We strongly recommend you make your event processing idempotent to avoid receiving duplicate notifications for the same events.
