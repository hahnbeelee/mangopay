### Description

The Bank Account object represents the actual bank account of the user and is therefore required to:  
- Process a bank wire payout  
- Set up a mandate to process a pay-in by direct debit with a mandate (BACS or SEPA network only)  

Different information is required for bank accounts in different countries. This is managed by the `Type` parameter, which determines the information that needs to be provided via the dedicated endpoint. The values are:   
- IBAN – For accounts registered in countries that use IBAN   
- US – For accounts registered in the United States   
- CA – For accounts registered in Canada  
- GB – For accounts registered in the United Kingdom  
- OTHER – For accounts registered in countries that do not use IBAN (and are not US, CA, GB).  

The country of registration of a bank account is not linked to its currency.  

<Warning>  
**Caution – Creating the wrong type can lead to processing delays** 
  
Failure to use the correct type can lead to processing delays. Use the dedicated types for US, CA, and GB. Only use OTHER if the country isn’t one of these and doesn’t use IBAN.  
</Warning>  

<Note>  
**Note – Bank Account creation blocked in restricted countries** 
  
Due to anti-money laundering policy, Mangopay doesn’t accept the creation of bank accounts registered in some countries (see the <a href="/guides/users/country-restrictions">Country restrictions</a> article).
