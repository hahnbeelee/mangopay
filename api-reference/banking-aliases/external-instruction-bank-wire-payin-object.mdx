title: 'The External Instruction Bank Wire PayIn object'

---
  
### Description

The External Instruction Bank Wire PayIn object represents a pay-in made to a Banking Alias directly from the end user bank. This pay-in is therefore not generated with the Mangopay API but created automatically upon receiving the funds.  

In Sandbox, you can use the "Create a banking alias payin" feature in the Dashboard Sandbox operations to create this object.

<Note>  
**Note â€“ `DebitedBankAccount` only available for EU IBAN** 
  
The `DebitedBankAccount` information may not be available for pay-ins made from non-EU IBANs.  
</Note>
