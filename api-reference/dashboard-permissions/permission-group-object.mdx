### Description
The Permission Group object sets a specific level of permissions for Dashboard users. Each SSO is assigned a Permission Group that defines which API elements the user is allowed to view, edit, and create in the Dashboard.  

By default, Mangopay provides 3 Permission Groups:  
- `READ` – Allows the Dashboard user to view operational data relating to users, payments, and compliance, but not platform settings.  
- `WRITE` – Allows the Dashboard user to view (like READ) and edit operational data relating to users, payments, and compliance, but not platform settings.  
- `ADMIN` – Allows the Dashboard user to view and edit operational data (like WRITE), as well as view and edit the platform settings (Client, SSO, and Permission Group objects).
