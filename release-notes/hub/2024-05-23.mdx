## Secure document upload for platforms' administrative documents

Hub users can now securely upload documents to our teams directly from the Hub, instead of using email. This enables platforms to securely transfer files when requested by Mangopay team members, for example during the platformâ€™s onboarding process.

You can find this feature in the _Company_ section of <a href="https://hub.mangopay.com/user-profile">your profile</a>.

To access this feature:

1. Log in to the <a href="https://hub.mangopay.com/">Mangopay Hub</a>.
2. On the top right, click on the user icon then click on _<a href="https://hub.mangopay.com/user-profile">Update profile</a>_.
3. Scroll down to find _Company_ and click _Upload_.
4. In the _Upload_ tab, click _Click to upload_ or drop your file to upload a new document
5. Your previously uploaded documents will be available in the _History_ tab.
