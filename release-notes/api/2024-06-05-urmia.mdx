### ValidationUsage parameter on card validation  

Platforms can now influence the likelihood of SCA on a card validation request thanks to the new `ValidationUsage` parameter, which indicates the intended usage of the card. The possible values are:  
- CIT – For customer-initiated transactions (CITs), meaning 3DS is less likely to be required on the card validation.  
- MIT – For merchant-initiated transactions (MITs), meaning 3DS is more likely to be required on the card validation.  

The `ValidationUsage` can be used along with `SecureMode` to influence the 3DS outcome.  

When the `SecureMode` value is `DEFAULT` or `NO_CHOICE`, platforms can set the `ValidationUsage` parameter to `CIT` to decrease the likelihood of SCA.  

Note that if the `SecureMode` value is `FORCE`, explicitly requesting SCA, then the `ValidationUsage` is set to `MIT` even if you send `CIT`.
