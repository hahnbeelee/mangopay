### 30-day preauthorization: Complement feature  

Platforms can now capture more funds than the preauthorized amount thanks to two new endpoints:  
- <a href="/api-reference/deposit-preauthorizations/create-deposit-preauthorized-payin-prior-to-complement">POST Create a Deposit Preauthorized PayIn prior to complement</a>
- <a href="/api-reference/deposit-preauthorizations/create-deposit-preauthorized-payin-complement">POST Create a Deposit Preauthorized PayIn complement</a>

The `PaymentStatus` parameter has the new value `TO_BE_COMPLETED`, indicating that the preauthorized funds were captured but the additional funds have not yet been captured.   

This feature can be useful if, for example, end users are benefiting from additional services or if damages have been incurred during a rental.

### 30-day preauthorization: No-show feature  

Platforms can also capture additional funds on an unused preauthorization.   

The `PaymentStatus` parameter has the new value `NO_SHOW_REQUESTED`, which can be used with the existing PUT endpoint:   
- <a href="/api-reference/deposit-preauthorizations/cancel-deposit-preauthorization-request-no-show">PUT Cancel a Deposit Preauthorization or request a no-show</a>

Platforms can then charge a complement using the new endpoint:  
- <a href="/api-reference/deposit-preauthorizations/create-deposit-preauthorized-payin-complement">POST Create a Deposit Preauthorized PayIn complement</a>

This feature enables platforms to charge a penalty fee for last-minute cancellations, for example.

### 30-day preauthorization: Additional endpoints and hooks  

Platforms can use the following new endpoints to take better advantage of the 30-day preauthorization feature:   
- <a href="/api-reference/deposit-preauthorizations/list-deposit-preauthorizations-card">GET List Deposit Preauthorizations for a Card</a>
- <a href="/api-reference/deposit-preauthorizations/list-deposit-preauthorizations-card-fingerprint">GET List Deposit Preauthorizations for a Card Fingerprint</a>
- <a href="/api-reference/deposit-preauthorizations/list-deposit-preauthorizations-user">GET List Deposit Preauthorizations for a User</a>
- <a href="api-reference/transactions/list-transactions-deposit-preauthorization">GET List Transactions for a Deposit Preauthorization</a>

New event types are also available for the complement and no-show features:   
- DEPOSIT_PREAUTHORIZATION_PAYMENT_NO_SHOW_REQUESTED  
- DEPOSIT_PREAUTHORIZATION_PAYMENT_NO_SHOW  
- DEPOSIT_PREAUTHORIZATION_PAYMENT_TO_BE_COMPLETED  
- DEPOSIT_PREAUTHORIZATION_PAYMENT_FAILED
