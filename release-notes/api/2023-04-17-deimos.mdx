### New KYC Document flag for paper-based formats  

It is now possible to know when an identity proof was refused because it was printed on paper, thanks to a new returned value in the `Flags` parameter of the <a href="/api-reference/kyc-documents/kyc-document-object">KYC Document</a> object:   
- 009026 – The document is considered paper-based (printed on paper), rather than being a card or passport format.  

For more information on flags and dealing with refused documents, see the <a href="/guides/users/verification/documents/submission/refusals">Verification – Document process</a> article.  

This flag may be returned for some documents from Indonesia and the Philippines. Previously, only the passport was accepted in these countries, whereas now other types of documents are accepted if they are not paper-based. See the <a href="/guides/users/verification/requirements/id-accepted">Accepted ID documents</a> article for more information.
