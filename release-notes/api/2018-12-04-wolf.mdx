### CVV culture  

We added a new `Culture` parameter on PayIns and PreAuthorizations objects. By filling this parameter with a country code (FR, EN, DE, ES, IT, NL, PL), you will be able to configure the language of the CVV page for each transaction.

### Error codes enhancements  

We are constantly improving the error codes and explanation we send you on every transaction. On this release we worked on erasing empty `ResultMessage` and `ResultCode`. Now 100% of the transactions will have appropriate error code.
