### Enhancements  

This small release includes some minor fixes and improvements  

Fix PayIn BankWire OwnerAddresss [v2.01]  

The OwnerAddress property is now a detailed address object, as for other address fields in v2.01 (more info)  

Allow address fields to be nullable [v2.01]  

Address fields in v2.01 can now be nullable, meaning they donâ€™t have to be updated during a PUT  

Make the version case insensitive [From v2.0]  

Previously the version used in the URL was case-sensitive, causing 404 errors in some cases  

Specify some iDeal error codes [From v2.0]  

Various iDeal transaction errors will now be correctly typed as for other transactions (more info)  

Fix a potential bug on User lists [From v2.0]  

A minor improvement has been applied to the User list call to prevent a 500 in some rare cases
