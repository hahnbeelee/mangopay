### Enhancements  

‘Empty body’ errors  

This error is often due to a syntax error. We also pushed a fix so you should get less and less this king of error.  

‘LegalRepresentativeAddress’ field in ‘users/legal’  

The ‘LegalRepresentativeAddress’ field in the ‘users/legal’ object did not keep the value sent, it remained at ‘null’. We pushed a fix to retrieve the values sent.  

New error specification for KYC documents  

If the Type of a document sent is not allowed for the associated user, before you received this error:  

`{ "Message": "Internal Server Error", "Type": "other", "Id": "d36a2340-2b43-482e-bba4-8b505bbb2a84", "Date »: 1385569350, "errors »: null }`  

Now, for this case, you are receiving this error:  

`{ "Message": "Error wrong type of document", "Type": "wrong_document_type" "Id": "f41983fb-a2c5-40fc-81a2-14c9fb58f207" "Date"": 1400675136 "errors": {error: "Document [IDENTITY_PROOF] is not valid for [LEGAL_PERSONALITY]"} }`

`{ "Message": "Wrong Type: ‘Document_Type_Variable’ is only used for legal users", "Type": "other", "Id": "d36a2340-2b43-482e-bba4-8b505bbb2a84", "Date": 1385569350, "errors": "Wrong_document_type" }`
