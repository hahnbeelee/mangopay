### KYC limits update  

We've rebuilt the KYC engine from the ground up to make it more powerful and intelligent – most notably, you can now consult the amount of cashin/cashout for a user to see how close to the KYC limits they are. 
  
### Enhancements  
-Correct a bug where by the StatementDescriptor was not taken into account in some cases for a payin card direct  
-Add client name and ID to dispute notification emails  
-You can now use the call for failed pay-ins (as well as successful ones)
