### Blocked users feature enhancements  

We have updated our compliance and fraud options regarding blocked users. The update may impact some of your users in the future.  

As you may already know, our teams can block any user at anytime for compliance or fraud issues Blocked Users. Until now, we could only block their payouts (outflows). But from now on, we can also block their inflows. In that case, it won't be possible for a user with his inflows blocked to do any payIn or preAuth. In that case, the transaction will fail and return the error 008700.
