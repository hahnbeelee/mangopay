### New payout refunds  

As you know, successful payouts can be rejected by the recipient bank (e.g., the bank account is now closed, or a savings account and can't receive funds). In this case, we will create a "payout refund" and the funds will be returned to the wallet. From now on, we'll also automatically disable the bank account so you can't use it again (if the refund reason is irreversible). 
  
### List Users for a Card Fingerprint endpoint  

Following our previous new functionality with regard to card fingerprints, we've added a new endpoint to list users that have registered the same card â€“ this is useful for checking for potentially fraudulent cases, or different users who are actually the same in real life, etc.

### Wrong wallet balance  

We've fixed an issue causing the wallet's amount to occasionally be wrong if too many transactions were done in parallel to the wallet 
  
### Payment methods naming  

We've fixed a very minor bug where the naming of some payment methods was different between the reporting tool and the API.  
  <div class="pill pill-blue rn-pill">Changed</div> 
  
### Information displayed on end users' bank statements  

Following your feedback, the wording "by MANGOPAY" is no longer included in the payout references shown on the end user's bank statement. 
  
### Improved performance  

We've completed the next stage in our performance and scalability improvements whereby you'll find that the card, card registration, and bank account list responses are now much quicker and more reliable.
