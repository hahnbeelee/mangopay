### New KYC Level hook  

A lot of you requested to have a clear notification when a user would become KYC verified: `"KYCLevel": "REGULAR"`. The KYC Regular hook enables you to get an event every time a user is validated by our compliance team.

### AVS score for AMEX  

For platforms using AMEX as a payment method, we have fixed the Address Verification System (AVS) that was not returning the correct score as some information was not correctly transmitted to AMEX. AVS is a powerful anti-fraud tool that we recommend you use as a criterion for 3DS activation.
