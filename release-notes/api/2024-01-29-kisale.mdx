### New endpoint to look up metadata from BIN or Google Pay token  

Platforms can look up metadata about a specific payment method used during a transaction thanks to a new endpoint:   
- <a href="/api-reference/payment-method-metadata/payment-method-metadata-object">POST Look up metadata for a payment method</a>

Using the issuer’s bank identification number (BIN), or a Google Pay payment token, platforms can obtain additional details about the issuer and country, as well as the card’s brand and type.
