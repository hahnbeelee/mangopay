### New UBO Declaration endpoint  

We added new endpoints to replace the manual shareholder declaration (KYC document) while offering you a better quality of service. You will now be able to declare the UBOs (Ultimate beneficial owner) through dedicated endpoints. 
  
### New company number accuracy checks  

We now verify the company number fields accuracy in all Europe. When you register a legal User with type business, we will check the patterns.
