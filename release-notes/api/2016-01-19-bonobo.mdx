### Enhancements  

KYC blocked PayOuts are now refused automatically for new clients [From v2]  

PayOuts that are blocked due to KYC limits are now automatically refused if there isn’t a KYC document pending verification. This will come into affect for old clients from April 2016.  

Add idempotency support [From v2]  

We’ve added an optional new feature for all POST requests that helps prevent duplicates.  

New aliases for client wallets [From v2]  

You’ll notice that your client wallets (Fees or Credit) now have a specific alias for their ID – for example, your Fees EUR wallet will now have the ID "FEES_EUR"  

Add new endpoint to view transfer settlements [From v2]  

We’ve add the endpoint /settlements/:SettlementId/ to view the details of a transfer settlement.  

Przelewy24 PayIns can now been refunded [From v2]  

It is now possible to refund Przelewy24 PayIns in the normal way.  

PayOuts were the funds are no longer available are now refused automatically [From v2]  

If there are no longer sufficient funds in the wallet to do a PayOut when processing it, we’ll now automatically refuse it.  

Fix a bug with preauthorizations not working in some cases [From v2]  

There was a bug in some unique cases when doing a payin preauthorization and it would fail – this has now been corrected  

Specify a PSP error where the connection was lost [From v2]  

In some rare cases when the connection was lost with our PSP, we didn’t correctly handle the error – this has now been corrected  

Fix confusing error messages for PayOuts < 0.10EUR [From v2]  

PayOuts for less than 0.10EUR (or the equivalent) previously had an incorrect error saying that there were unsufficent funds – this has now been corrected.
