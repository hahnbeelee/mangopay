### New MOTO payment category  

Card payments by mail order or telephone order (MOTO) can now be differentiated from online payments.  

This is possible with the new optional `PaymentCategory` parameter, whose value can be set to:  
-`ECommerce` – For payments received online.   
-`TelephoneOrder` – For payments received via mail order or telephone order (MOTO).   

MOTO transactions are out of scope of SCA because the buyer is not present, so the platform is always responsible in case of chargebacks. For more information, see the <a href="/guides/payment-methods/card/3ds">3DS</a> article.   

The ability to process MOTO transactions must be approved and activated by Mangopay.  

The `PaymentCategory` parameter is available on the following endpoints:  
- <a href="/api-reference/card-validations/create-card-validation">POST Create a Card Validation</a>
- <a href="/api-reference/direct-card-payins/create-direct-card-payin">POST Create a Direct Card PayIn</a>
- <a href="/api-reference/preauthorizations/create-preauthorization">POST Create a Preauthorization</a>
