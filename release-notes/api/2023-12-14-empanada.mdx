### Card validation feature now available  

Platforms can now validate a newly registered card via 3DS authentication without debiting a transaction.   

This feature allows platforms to verify that the card belongs to the user who registered it, and that the issuer authorizes the use of the card (for example, that it’s not blocked).   

Two new endpoints have been added to the API:  
- <a href="/api-reference/card-validations/create-card-validation">POST Create a Card Validation</a>
- <a href="/api-reference/card-validations/view-card-validation">GET View a Card Validation</a>

There are new event types for <a href="/webhooks">webhook</a> notifications relating to the Card Validation object:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th class="header">Name</th>
<th class="header">ResourceId</th>
<th class="header">Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="table-content">CARD_VALIDATION_CREATED</td>
<td class="table-content">CardValidationId</td>
<td class="table-content">The Card Validation object has been created and the card is pending validation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="table-content">CARD_VALIDATION_FAILED</td>
<td class="table-content">CardValidationId</td>
<td class="table-content">The Card Validation has failed, setting the corresponding card as invalid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="table-content">CARD_VALIDATION_SUCCEEDED</td>
<td class="table-content">CardValidationId</td>
<td class="table-content">The Card Validation has succeeded, setting the corresponding card as valid.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
