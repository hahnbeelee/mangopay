### New rate limiting feature  

We have now activated rate limiting for the API. More info here. If you are likely to be impacted, you will have already been notified. 
  
### New parameters for the reporting endpoint  

We've added UserId and WalletId to the reporting endpoints.  
  <div class="pill pill-blue rn-pill">Changed</div> 
  
### Enhancements  
-We've made various optimisations to the way transactions are handled, in a vary of cases - this improves reliablity and reduces responses times/error 500s  
-We've improved a constraint not allowing for refunds within 24h when the first refund actually failed  
-Add a constraint for GB bank accounts that requires 8 digits in the AccountNumber - the validation service we used already required this, but there were some cases where an incorrect length was possible
