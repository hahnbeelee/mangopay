### New functionalities  

Direct Debit payments [From v2]  

You can now do PayIns via direct debit (although in production you’ll need to contact support to have this activated for your account).  

New API endpoint to specify branding preferences [From v2.01]  

We’ve added a new endpoint allowing you to upload your company logo and choose various theme colours – currently this is only used for the direct debit PayIns but they will be used elsewhere soon.

### Enhancements  

Fix an occasional bug with iDeal payments [From v2]  

There was a bug in some unique cases when doing an iDeal PayIn whereby it would be prematurely failed, even though it was later successful – this has now been corrected.  

Improve idempotency support [From v2]  

In some cases, the response given for an idempotency key lookup was wrong – we’ve reviewed this and added a patch to ensure it can’t happen.  

Improve transactional emails [From v2]  

We’ve started work to improve the design and deliverability of our transactional emails.  

Improvements to refund checks [From v2]  

We’ve added a couple of improvements to the way we check various things before doing a PayIn refund to ensure better reliability.
