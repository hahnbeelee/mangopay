### Handling of disputes  

For each chargeback, you’ll find a Dispute case that you can view and manage from the API or your Dashboard – you’ll also be sent an email notification. There is no breaking change to the previous workflow as such, but there are a few important improvements you should be aware of.  

From API point of view, there are new events/hooks, dispute managements and dispute document management (all of which can be handled from the Dashboard, as usual). 
  
### New payment method – Bancontact/Mister Cash (BCMC)  

BCMC is now available as a card pay-in (direct/token or via the web interface). 
  
### Enhancements  

Postal codes no longer required for certain Countries [v2.01]  

We’ve adapted the constraints when adding detailed addresses in v2.01 so that `PostalCode` is no longer required for countries that do not support this data.  

PayIn URLs [From v2.0]  

The URLs used for PayIns (ReturnURL, SecureModeReturnURL, etc.) can now be much longer than previous.  

Fix ResourceId bug for PayOut refunds [From v2.0]  

Fix a bug where the ResourceId for a payout refund in the events list could be wrong.  

Fix a PayIn refund problem [From v2.0]  

Non-EUR PayIns with fees could in some cases not be refunded – this is now fixed.  

Add some iDeal specific error codes [From v2.0]  

For certain iDeal error casses – more info (under the "iDeal" heading).  

Add further stability to sandbox [From v2.0]  

In certain rare cases, the sandbox could respond with error 500s at times – this has now been fixed.  

Prevent refund of disputed PayIns [From v2.0]  

If a PayIn has a dispute against it, the transaction can no longer be refunded.
