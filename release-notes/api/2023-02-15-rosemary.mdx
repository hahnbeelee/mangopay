### New restrictions on user nationality parameters  

The user `Nationality` and `LegalRepresentativeNationality` parameters are now checked for restrictions when creating or updating a user. As a result, the following occurs:  
- An error is returned when attempting to create a user with a restricted country as a nationality value.  
- Users are automatically blocked when updated with a restricted country as a nationality value.  

The following endpoints have been updated to take into account this change:  
- <a href="/api-reference/users/create-natural-user">Create a Natural User</a>
- <a href="/api-reference/users/create-legal-user">Create a Legal User</a>
- <a href="/api-reference/users/update-natural-user">Update a Natural User</a>
- <a href="/api-reference/users/update-legal-user">Update a Legal User</a>

This enhancement aims to increase the safety of the Mangopay solution in regards to countries posing a potential risk.
