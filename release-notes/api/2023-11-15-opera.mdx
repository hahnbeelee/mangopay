### SpotFX: Instant Conversions now available

The rate offered by Mangopay can be viewed in real-time via the <a href="/api-reference/conversion-rates/view-conversion-rate">View an indicative Conversion Rate</a> endpoint.   

Mangopay’s SpotFX feature allows platforms to offer their users multi-currency wallet balances across GBP, EUR, and USD.
