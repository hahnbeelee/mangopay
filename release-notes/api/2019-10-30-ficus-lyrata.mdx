### CVV card number and expiry date on iOS

### UBO Declaration is now mandatory  

Six months ago, we launched the UBO declaration feature to make KYC process for businesses easier. Since the 16/09/2019, this feature is mandatory for the KYC validation. In order to ease up the process, we now allow you to check all the UBO declaration for a user sorted by date.
