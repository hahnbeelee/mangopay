### Missing information on debited bank account  

A number of platforms use the banking alias feature to generate IBAN linked to a wallet and ease up the bank wire process PayIn. For the Target 2 payments (instants international transfer) received on ibanized wallet, we failed to provide information on the debited bank account (OwnerName, IBAN, BIC, Type). We have solved this issue.  
  <div class="pill pill-blue rn-pill">Changed</div> 
  
### Additional information returned on preauthorization  

We noticed that on PreAuthorization we failed to display some information on the GET: `Culture`, `Billing`, and `SecurityInfo`. We now manage to provide you those key parameters. 
  
### Empty errors removed  

In our constant effort to improve the error code on every endpoints of our API, we decided to remove empty error codes on the POST Mandates and Wallets endpoints.
