### New Address parameters for bank accounts  

This minor API version relates to having more detailed addresses for Users and Bank Accounts. It will be available from 20th July 2015 and will be mandatory from 15th September 2015 if you wish to do PayOuts to CA, or US-type bank accounts.  

### Changes to API objects  

An address is currently used in the following objects:  
- Natural User – Address  
- Legal User – LegalRepresentativeAddress and HeadquartersAddress  
- BankAccounts – OwnerAddress  

In each case, the previous string format is no longer accepted, and a more detailed array of information is required. Further information is available below:

As with the previous address fields for the User, it is still optional to provide the address information when creating a User, however if you do provide at least one of the new address fields, you must provide a complete address (except AddressLine2).  
```json Example request for POST /v2.01/ClientId/users/natural
{
    "FirstName":"Joe",
    "LastName":"Blogs",
    "Email":"mangopay@oasis.com",
    "Address":{
        "AddressLine1":"1 Mangopay Street",
        "AddressLine2":"The Loop",
        "City":"Paris",
        "Region":"Ile de France",
        "PostalCode":"75001",
        "Country":"FR"
    },
    "Tag":"custom meta"
}
```  

### Changes to API calls  

#### POST /users/UserId/bankaccounts  

The OwnerAddress field no longer accepts a string, but instead an array of fields, as detailed above. This sub-object is still a required property when creating a Bank Account  

#### POST and PUT /users/natural/  

The Address field no longer accepts a string, but instead an array of fields, as detailed above. This sub-object is still optional when creating a User.  

#### POST and PUT /users/legal/  

The LegalRepresentativeAddress and HeadquartersAddress fields no longer accept a string, but instead an array of fields, as detailed above. These sub-objects are still optional when creating a User.  

### Updating historical data  

In v2.01 it is impossible to obtain the address you added with v2 – you are therefore advised to migrate this information between the two versions (in the meantime, an address added in v2 will be shown as null in v2.01).  

You can use the PUT method to update the additional address info for previously created Users. However, there is no PUT method to update Bank Accounts (due to compliance and traceability issues), which means you will have to create a new Bank Account with the additional address info and stop using any previously created Bank Accounts.
