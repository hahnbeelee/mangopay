### New View Bank Accounts for a User endpoint  

We’ve added a new endpoint to help you list all the bank accounts for a given user. 
  
### Card Fingerprint enhancement  

We’re excited to present you the progress made with the Fingerprint features (unique card identifier). We’ve generated a Fingerprint for every card used to do a Payin Web. And it is now possible to list all the transactions for a Fingerprint. 
  
### New PayPal soft descriptor  

We’ve added a soft descriptor for PayPal transactions.

### 45-day historical data on events  

We fixed the issues we had on the GET /events/ endpoint by limiting the historical data search to 45 days.
