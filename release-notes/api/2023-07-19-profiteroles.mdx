### Partial Refunds for Transfers now available  

Platforms can now specify a refund amount that is less than the initial transfer, thanks to the addition of the `DebitedFunds` and `Fees` parameters on the <a href="/api-reference/refunds/create-refund-transfer">Create a Refund for a Transfer</a> endpoint.  

The `Fees` parameter can also be used to include or exclude the reimbursement of the initial transfer’s fees from the platform’s Fees Wallet.  

The following endpoints and resources have been updated accordingly:
