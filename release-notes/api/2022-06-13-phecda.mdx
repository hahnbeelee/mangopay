### New errors for unreadable KYC documents  

The reasons why a KYC document could not be processed are now more precise thanks to two new errors:  
-Low-resolution image – The document information is not readable because the image resolution is too low (009024).  
-Black and white picture – The document information is not readable because the image is in black and white (009025).  

<Note>  
**Note – Change in returned error** 
  
Prior to this release, we used to return the 009009 error (with the `RefusedReasonType` DOCUMENT_NOT_ACCEPTED) instead of the 009024 error (DOCUMENT_UNREADABLE).
