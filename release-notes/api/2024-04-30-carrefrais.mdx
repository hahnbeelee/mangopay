### Error 121009: Payout expired before processing  

The following `ResultCode` and `ResultMessage` can be returned on payouts:  
- 121009
- Payout expired before processing  

This error occurs when a payout stays in `CREATED` status longer than 7 days without the funds being sent by Mangopay.  

Some payouts are subject to manual review by Mangopay’s teams for reasons of risk management or AML/CFT. If this review is not completed within 7 days, the payout expires.  

See the dedicated [121009](/errors/codes/121009) page for more details. 
  
### Error 130011: Instant payout mode prevents manual review  

The following `ResultCode` and `ResultMessage` can be returned on payouts:  
- 130011   
- Manual review required - not compatible with payout mode requested  

This error occurs when a manual review is required on an instant payout requested with `INSTANT_PAYMENT_ONLY` as the value for `PayoutModeRequested`.  

The mode has no fallback to standard processing to enable the review, so an error is returned.  

See the dedicated [130011](/errors/codes/130011) page for more details. 
  
### Error 002701: Payer user requests payout  

The following `ResultCode` and `ResultMessage` can be returned on payouts:  
- 002701   
- Refused due to author’s UserCategory: PAYER  

This error occurs when a payout is requested for a Payer user. Payouts can only be requested if the user’s `UserCategory` is `OWNER`, and the user must also be verified.  

See the dedicated [002701](/errors/codes/002701) page for more details.
