### Transaction objects no longer retrievable past 13 months  

Transaction objects can no longer be retrieved via the API once `CreationDate` is 13 months in the past. Previously, there was no time limitation on retrieving live transactions.  

All transactions are affected by this change, of every `Type` (`PAYIN`, `TRANSFER`, `CONVERSION`, `PAYOUT`) and `Nature` (`REGULAR`, `REPUDIATION`, `REFUND`, `SETTLEMENT`).   

The new data availability period applies to API requests to retrieve by Object ID (e.g. <a href="/api-reference/payouts/view-payout">GET View a Payout</a>) and requests to list transactions (e.g. <a href="https://beta-docs.mangopay.com/api-reference/transactions/list-transactions-user">GET List Transactions for a User</a>).
