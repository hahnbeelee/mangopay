### New ClosedDate parameter for disputes  

Knowing when a dispute was closed is now possible thanks to the new `ClosedDate` parameter for the Dispute object.  

The following endpoints have been updated accordingly:  
- <a href="/api-reference/disputes/view-dispute">View a Dispute</a>
- <a href="/api-reference/disputes/list-disputes-user">List Disputes for a User</a>
- <a href="/api-reference/disputes/list-disputes-wallet">List Disputes for a Wallet</a>
- <a href="/api-reference/disputes/list-disputes">List all Disputes</a>
- <a href="/api-reference/disputes/list-disputes-settlement">List Disputes pending settlement</a>

<Note>  
**Note â€“ This enhancement only impacts new disputes** 
  
The new `ClosedDate` parameter will only display values for the Disputes closed after the Guzmania release. Otherwise, a `null` value will be returned.  
</Note>  

Thanks to this new parameter, the platforms can now review when disputes are closed and can report on their losses on a regular basis.
