## New recurring card pay-in feature

To improve recurring card payments and to comply with PSD2, we are developing a dedicated feature. We have added a specific workflow to allow you to start testing in Sandbox, to help you define your workflow for recurring payments.

As a first step, with this release you are now able to:
- Create a Recurring PayIn Registration object, containing all the information to define the recurring payment
- Initiate your recurring payment flow with an authenticated transaction (CIT) using the Card Recurring PayIn endpoint
- Continue your recurring payment flow with a non-authenticated transaction (MIT) using the Card Recurring PayIn endpoint

This feature is dedicated to platforms needing to charge a card repeatedly, such as subscriptions or payment installments. This release provides the first elements of the full feature, which will include flows for re-authentication and migration of existing recurring payments.
