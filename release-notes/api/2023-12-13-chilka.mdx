### New CardInfo parameter returned on card transactions  

Endpoints that trigger card authorization now return information about the card used for the transaction.  

The `CardInfo` object parameter has the following child parameters:  
- `BIN` – The 6-digit bank identification number (BIN) of the card issuer.  
- `IssuingBank` – The name of the card issuer.  
- `IssuerCountryCode` – The country where the card was issued.  
- `Type` – The type of card product: DEBIT, CREDIT, CHARGE CARD.  
- `Brand` – The card brand. Examples include: AMERICAN EXPRESS, DISCOVER, JCB, MASTERCARD, VISA, etc.  
- `SubType` – The subtype of the card product. Examples include: CLASSIC, GOLD, PLATINUM, PREPAID, etc.  

**Note:** The possible returned values for `Brand` and `SubType` are numerous and liable to evolve over time.  

If any data point is not available, `null` is returned.
