### New 30-day preauthorization feature  

Preauthorizations can now hold funds for up to 30 days, therefore ensuring the solvency of a registered card for the same amount of time.  

The following endpoints have been added to hold the funds and capture the payment on a 30-day period:  
-The Deposit PreAuthorization object  
-Create a Deposit PreAuthorization  
-Cancel a Deposit PreAuthorization  
-View a Deposit PreAuthorization  
-The PreAuthorized Deposit PayIn object  
-Create a PreAuthorized Deposit PayIn  

Thanks to 30-day preauthorizations, MANGOPAY can provide a simpler and more flexible payment experience for a wide range of use cases, especially for rentals.
