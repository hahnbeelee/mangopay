### UserCategory parameter  

Users can now be differentiated depending on their MANGOPAY usage.  

This is possible with the new `UserCategory` parameter, whose value can be set to:  
-Payer – For users who are only using MANGOPAY to give money to other users (i.e., only pay).  
-Owner – For users who are using MANGOPAY to receive funds (and who are therefore required to accept MANGOPAY’s terms and conditions).  

Please note that the following parameters become required as soon as the `UserCategory` is set to “Owner”: `HeadquartersAddress`, `CompanyNumber` (if the `LegalPersonType` is “Business”), as well as the `TermsAndConditionsAccepted`.  

The documentation of user-related endpoints has been updated to take into account the new parameter:  
-Create a Natural User  
-Update a Natural User  
-Create a Legal User  
-Update a Legal User  
-View a User  
-List all Users  

Differentiating the platform users results in a smoother user experience for “Payers” as they will have less declarative data to provide.  

This change has an impact on existing customers as the User Category parameter will become mandatory in the coming months. At that point, the following will occur:  
-As a platform, you will be required to provide MANGOPAY with the `TermsAndConditionsAccepted` parameter value for all users defined as owners.  
-MANGOPAY will categorize existing users as owners or payers based on their activity.  

<Warning>  
**Warning** 
  
Not implementing this change will make it impossible to create new users.  
</Warning> 
  
### Recurring PayIn Registration events  

Recurring payment registration event types are now available for hook notifications.  

Setting a hook up for the following `EventType` will trigger the corresponding notifications:  
-RECURRING_REGISTRATION_CREATED  
-RECURRING_REGISTRATION_AUTH_NEEDED  
-RECURRING_REGISTRATION_IN_PROGRESS  
-RECURRING_REGISTRATION_ENDED  

This results in better monitoring of the recurring pay-in registration and offers more flexibility to manage recurring objects.
