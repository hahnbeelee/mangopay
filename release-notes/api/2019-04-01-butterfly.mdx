### New retry feature on hooks  

We now perform retry on Hooks. For any failed hook (no response 200), we will resend the notification every ten minutes during the first hour and every eight hours for three days. This will guarantee a higher synchronisation of data and status between your application and Mangopay. 
  
### New restrictions by country  

In order to improve security and reduce the risk on your platforms, we have added constraints on users residing in forbidden countries. Please be aware that you won't be able to create users from those countries.   

NB: This list is regularly updated by the European authorities

### Email for disputes  

We have fixed a bug that prevented us to send you email for any dispute created. You will now have the notification on your mail box, so you can treat it.
