{/* Imports */}  

Mangopay provides the ability to generate reports so you can download a large amount of data in CSV format for accounting or analysis purposes.   

Two types of report are available via the API:

<table class="header-column">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th class="header">Transactions&nbsp;report</th>
      <td class="table-content">
        Provides the pay-ins, payouts, transfers, and conversions made on the platform. This includes all natures of transaction (regular, refund, repudiation, and settlement).  

        The report period can’t exceed 6 months, and transactions can’t be more than 36 months past their creation date.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th class="header">Wallets&nbsp;report</th>
      <td class="table-content">
        Provides all the wallets created on the platform, whether they are the end user’s, or the platform’s (repudiation and fees wallets).  

        The report period can’t exceed 24 months by a wallet’s creation date.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Report creation flow  

When creating a report with the dedicated endpoints, its `Status` is `PENDING` at first, until it becomes ready for download. There is a short waiting time, (usually a few seconds) which depends on the size of the requested report.  

When the report status becomes `READY_FOR_DOWNLOAD`, a notification is sent to the `CallbackURL` (if set) with the following format: 

> https<span>://www</span>.example.com?EventType=REPORT_READY_FOR_DOWNLOAD&ResourceId=`ReportId`&Date=`ReportDate`

Using the `ReportId`, you can use the View a Report endpoint to get the `DownloadURL`, where the report is available for download.  

A report expires after 24 hours (i.e., you can no longer download it after this period). You can still generate a new report with the same filters and information easily.  

## Setting up a transactions report  

### Columns  

On the <a href="/api-reference/reports/create-transactions-report">POST Create a Transactions Report</a> endpoint, you can add the following values in the `Columns` parameter to choose which information should be included in the report.

### Filters  

In order to optimize the report, you can take advantage of a series of filters available in the <a href="/api-reference/reports/create-transactions-report">Create a Transactions Report</a> endpoint documentation.  

Thanks to the `BeforeDate` and `AfterDate` filters, you can define a time range based on the `CreationDate` of the transactions. The date range can’t exceed 6 months, and you can’t view transactions which occurred more than 36 months in the past.
